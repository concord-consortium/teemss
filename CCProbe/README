CCProbe README, March 18, 2002

CCProbe is an open-source application developed at the Concord
Consortium that is scriptable, configurable, and supports probe-based
visualization, analysis, and calibration components. CCProbe also
includes components for folders, text, drawings, and images, which can
be integrated with the probeware to create curricular activities and a
lab book portfolio in which work can be saved and shared. CCProbe has
been specifically designed to run well on handheld computers such as
those running PalmOS or Microsoft PocketPC. Written in Waba, an open
source subset of Java specifically designed for Handheld computers
CCProbe is licensed under the GPL and it runs on PalmOS, WinCE,
PocketPC, Windows, MacOS, and Unix.  

CCProbe is the first program written using the CC LabBook
architecture. The CC LabBook system is the underlying software
architecture that supports a multi-platform object-oriented
portfolio. This portfolio can contain curricular activities, student
work and assessments.  CCProbe and the CCLabBook system are written in
Waba, an open source Java-like language for handhelds which runs on a
wide range of operating systems including PalmOS, WinCE, PocketPC,
Windows, MacOS Classic, MacOS X, Linux and other Unix operating
systems. This means that not only does our software runs on almost any
computer made in the last five years. As new computers and operating
systems are created, the software will quickly run on those, as well.

The current projects at the Concord Consortium contributing to the
development of CCProbe are: 

- Technology Enhanced Elementary and Middle School Science (TEEMSS)
- Data and Models
- Electronic Guidebook (Exploratorium)
- Modeling across the Curriculum (MAC)

The Concord Consortium [http://concord.org] is a tax-exempt non-profit
education research and development organization. The appearance of
new, emerging technologies has the potential to ignite explosive
strides in learning capacity and curriculum development. Harnessing
these technological resources can result in a powerful extension of
educational resources to all people, regardless of their
circumstances. The Concord Consortium is committed to leading this
drive forward by developing and using the best in educational
technology.

Building CCProbe from the ccprobe-src.tar.gz tarball archive:

tar -xzf ccprobe-src.tar.gz

cd ccprobe-src/CCProbe
make build-local
cd ../XML2LabBook
make
cd ../CCProbe/CCProbeXML
./make-xml
./make-labbook
./ccprobe

*** Problem building CCProbe.prc on MacOSX ***

The Palm assembler Pila does not build properly on MacOSX.  You will
need to get a complied copy of Pila for MacOSX and copy it to the
ccprobe-src/palmtools/bin directory.  You can get a copy here:
