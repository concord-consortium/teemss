MINOR

- Fix units in datacollectors
- Use secondary storage in Graph Bins.  This should decrease out of memory
  errors.
- Add UI to check battery level.
- Id probe cards
- Check error codes from smart wheel 
- Garbage Collect LabBook (currently this is done on the Desktop)
- Text box auto word wrap
- Multi-depth paging view folders
- One format of labbook on all systems.  Make palm catalogs work on 
	CE.
- Add tool to synchronized the temperatures of two or more temp probes
- Add "title bar" to more of the palm objects.  This is trick because it
	needs mainly handled by the MainView but also customizable
to be abstracted but also customizable 
- Show dialog while saving data and allow the user to change the name
- Show the title correctly when displaying a saved data set.
- Fix calibration dialog
- Fix eraser in Drawing
- Fix popup keyboard needs caps, and multiline.
- Double collect should beep and or show dialog box.
- Use unit prefixes instead of exponents when possible.
- DataSets don't save the precision of the their data.
- The size of the the digital display is fixed.  It should change
	depending on the size/precision of the data.
- Change the "Collect" button so it is more clear, perhaps change name
    while collecting.  (Start/Stop) ???
- Move 10^-3 on the axis label.
- yAxis Label on Bar graph is missing
- Line and Bar graph yaxis are not synchronized correctly.  Currently the 
    the Bar graph inherites the yaxis from the line graph, but then the
	line graph doesn't inherit the axis from the bar graph.
- set window location of dialogs relative to the upper left corner
  of the main window - add tab to sequence through fields of dialog 
- add optional default property to dialog button which is mapped to the
  return key and draws the button in a bolder outline to indicate a default
  selection
- dialogs should remember the selections used during their last invocation
  and use these as the defaults for the subsequent invocation -- for example
  when creating a second new temperature datacollector the probe type 
  should default to temperature the second time through
- add double-click on bar opening of annotate mark when viewing bar graph
- display time values in bar graph
- when a selection rectangle is made on the graph display statistics
  including X and Y extent
- check for data-to-be-saved when leaving datacollector via paging mode next/prev

MAJOR

- Question/Form object that handles multiple responses.
- Palm Desktop conduit that only updates what needs to be updated 
	on palm.
- Editable SuperNotes.
- Saving labbook in XML
- Converting all labbook objects to new Portfolio API.
- Add external DataBase links to Portfolio.
- Add synchronized/cached objects from external DataBase.
- Toggle between velocity and distance graphs.  This should convert
	the current graph data.
- UI and underlying structures for selecting different interfaces
- copy graph data in export format into system clipboard

Subject: CCProbe needs

Our filming of 5th/6th graders using Palms and probes at Touchstone School went very well. It should be good material to get our message across, when it comes out next spring. We'll see.

From a technical point of view, things worked well. The kids were able to figure out the Palms and CCProbe quite quickly. They were comfortable and eager. A number of improvements/changes/additions suggested themselves, as the activities unfolded. I'm sure many are on the list already.

1. When you save a dataset, it should ask you to name it right at that point. Doing it later is confusing and a pain. For example, suppose I do three runs with the same probe, and save it three times. I would need to record elsewhere what each run was, then open the menu and recall which of the three "dataset" files was which, then rename them. It's easy to make mistakes.

2. The notes don't have functional capitalization.

3.  The notes and drawings should be named in the same way -- at the time they are saved.

4. Notes and drawing must be closely connected to data graphs. You just can't do good data collection and observation if you must go elsewhere to write down these observations. Which cart was I pulling that time? What did I do differently from a previous run? What did that bump mean? and so forth. It would be ideal to write notes on the graph or next to it, so you could see the graph and write about it at the same time. The present graph notes don't work. Where would they appear?

5. The CCProbe drawing program worked very well. They liked it and used it. I was able to beam datasets and drawings. However, the awkwardness of the naming process limited the usefulness of all this data sending.

6. When you save, then replay a data set, the title does not appear. You must recall which data you are looking at. Not helpful. Perhaps the file name should appear on the graph. The same suggestion applies to drawings and notes.
I noticed that the Palm Memo Pad solves "names" by taking the first line as the displayed name of the file.

7. You stilll can't do multiple data collection runs on the same graph, on the Palm. But it's a  feature that would have helped us several times.

8. The graph scrolling and resizing was a big hit. But whatever can be done make it happen with less hesitation will be quite valuable.

9. We should think about how to simplify (and speed up!) the process of uploading datasets and drawings to a desktop. I beamed everything to a single Palm with its labbook deleted, and then uploaded that. That wasn't bad, once I figured out where Palm puts the files....

I'm sure you'll put these concerns into a more coherent plan and implement them all as soon as that next grant rolls in.
