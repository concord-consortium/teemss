MINOR

- Fix units in datacollectors
- Use secondary storage in Graph Bins.  This should decrease out of memory
  errors.
- Add UI to check battery level.
- Id probe cards
- Check error codes from smart wheel 
- Garbage Collect LabBook (currently this is done on the Desktop)
- Text box auto word wrap
- Multi-depth paging view folders
- One format of labbook on all systems.  Make palm catalogs work on 
	CE.
- Add tool to synchronized the temperatures of two or more temp probes
- Add "title bar" to more of the palm objects.  This is trick because it
	needs mainly handled by the MainView but also customizable
to be abstracted but also customizable 
- Show dialog while saving data and allow the user to change the name
- Show the title correctly when displaying a saved data set.
- Fix calibration dialog
- Fix eraser in Drawing
- Fix popup keyboard needs caps, and multiline.
- Double collect should beep and or show dialog box.
- Use unit prefixes instead of exponents when possible.
- DataSets don't save the precision of the their data.
- The size of the the digital display is fixed.  It should change
	depending on the size/precision of the data.
- Change the "Collect" button so it is more clear, perhaps change name
    while collecting.  (Start/Stop) ???
- Move 10^-3 on the axis label.
- yAxis Label on Bar graph is missing
- Line and Bar graph yaxis are not synchronized correctly.  Currently the 
    the Bar graph inherites the yaxis from the line graph, but then the
	line graph doesn't inherit the axis from the bar graph.
- set window location of dialogs relative to the upper left corner
  of the main window - add tab to sequence through fields of dialog 
- add optional default property to dialog button which is mapped to the
  return key and draws the button in a bolder outline to indicate a default
  selection
- dialogs should remember the selections used during their last invocation
  and use these as the defaults for the subsequent invocation -- for example
  when creating a second new temperature datacollector the probe type 
  should default to temperature the second time through
- add double-click on bar opening of annotate mark when viewing bar graph
- display time values in bar graph
- when a selection rectangle is made on the graph display statistics
  including X and Y extent
- check for data-to-be-saved when leaving datacollector via paging mode next/prev

MAJOR

- Question/Form object that handles multiple responses.
- Palm Desktop conduit that only updates what needs to be updated 
	on palm.
- Editable SuperNotes.
- Saving labbook in XML
- Converting all labbook objects to new Portfolio API.
- Add external DataBase links to Portfolio.
- Add synchronized/cached objects from external DataBase.
- Toggle between velocity and distance graphs.  This should convert
	the current graph data.
- UI and underlying structures for selecting different interfaces
- copy graph data in export format into system clipboard
