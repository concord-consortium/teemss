To process the docbook xml files you will need a copy of the v4.1.2
DocBook XML dtd and associated files.  You can get the docbkx412
dir here:

  http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/index.shtml

Unpack the docbkx412.zip archive into the doc/ directory.

The xml files are meant to be proccessed with Norman Walsh's DocBook
XSL files.  I used the docbook-xsl-1.48 distribution which is
available in the Files area at:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/



However there are a number of issues when using this xsl and fop
v0.20.rc3.  In the doc/ directory is a file named customization.xsl.
This is used to override some of the functions in the
docbook-xsl-1.48/fo/ xsl files in order to make the fo output work
more cleanly with fop.  After downloading the docbook-xsl-1.48
distribution unpack it in this directory and copy the file
customization.xsl into docbook-xsl-1.48/fo.
