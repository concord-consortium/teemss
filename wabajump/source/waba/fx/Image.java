/**
 * Sets one or more row(s) of pixels in an image. This method sets the values of
 * a number of pixel rows in an image and is commonly used when writing code
 * to load an image from a stream such as a file. The source pixels byte array
 * must be in 1, 4 or 8 bit per pixel format with a matching color map size
 * of 2, 16 or 256 colors.
 * <p>
 * Each color in the color map of the source pixels is identified by a single
 * integer value. The integer is composed of 8 bits (value [0..255]) of red,
 * green and blue using the following calculation:
 * <pre>
 * int color = (red << 16) | (green << 8) | blue;
 * </pre>
 * As an example, to load a 16 color image, we would pass bitsPerPixel
 * as 4 and would create a int array of 16 values for the color map.
 * Then we would set each of the values in the color map to the colors
 * used using the equation above. We could then either read data line
 * by line from the source stream, calling this method for each row of
 * pixels or could read a number of rows at once and then call this
 * method to set the pixels.
 * <p>
 * The former approach uses less memory, the latter approach is faster.
 *
 * @param bitsPerPixel bits per pixel of the source pixels (1, 4 or 8)
 * @param colorMap the color map of the source pixels (must be 2, 16 or 256 in length)
