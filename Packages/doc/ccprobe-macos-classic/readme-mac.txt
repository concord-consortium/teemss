MRJ for MacOSClassic implements the Java 1.1 standard.  The most recent version ofMRJ is version 2.2.5.  You can get the latest version of MRJ here:   http://www.info.apple.com/support/downloads.html  search for "mrj"MRJ for MacOS Classic is also available here:  http://developer.apple.com/java/classic.htmlWhich links to the file for MRJ 2.2.5 here:  http://developer.apple.com/java/classic.htmlAfter installing MRJ you can start the application CCProbe bydouble-clicking it.------------------------------------------------------------------------Setting the location of the Serial Communications PortThe first time CCProbe attempts to connect to the CCProbe interfacethrough the serial port it will ask which serial port to use toconnect to the interface.If you use an older Macintosh with a serial port you will most likelyselect either the Printer/Modem port or if you have two serial portsselect the Printer port.  If you have troubles connecting make surethat Appletalk is not already trying to use the serial port by openingthe Appletalk control panel.  If AppleTalk is using a serial port thenyou can turn appletalk off with a small control at the bottom of theChooser window.------------------------------------------------------------------------Changing the CCProbe application window sizeLoad the file CCProbe.properties into an program which can edit a textfile such as Eudora, BBEdit, or SimpletextLook for the following line:  com.apple.mrj.application.parameters=/color /w 600 /h 400 CCProbeThe numbers after the /w and /h set the width and the height of theapplication window.  Edit these numbers and save the file.  The nexttime the CCProbe application is run it will use the new specificationas the window size.
