After downloading CCProbe run the RXTX installerRXTX.pkg located in the ccprobe-macosx folder.Start CCProbe by opening the application file CCProbe.  CCProbe willautomatically open the LabBook.PDB file in the same folder in which itis located.  If there is no LabBook.PDB file it will create a newempty one.------------------------------------------------------------------------Communicating Serially to the CCProbe InterfaceMost MacOS X systems do not have a serial port built-in.  You willneed to install a USB-to-serial adaptor and a software driver for thatadaptor.  We have used the Keyspan USA-19 and USA-19W successfully.  http://www.keyspan.comSpecifying the location of the Serial Communications PortThe first time CCProbe attempts to connect to the interface throughthe serial port it will ask which serial port to use to connect to theinterface.  You can also use the file menu "Serial Port Settings" tochange the serial port used.------------------------------------------------------------------------Changing the CCProbe application window size1. control click on CCProbe package2. choose "Show Package Content"3. go to folder :Contents:Resources4. open file "MRJApp.properties" with the TextEdit application   (/Applications/TextEdit)5. Look for the following line:   com.apple.mrj.application.parameters=/color /w 400 /h 300 CCProbe6. The numbers after the /w and /h set the width and the height of the    application window.  Edit these numbers and save the file.  The next    time the CCProbe application is run it will use the new      specification as the window size.
