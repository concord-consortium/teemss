CCProbe Package Release System

There is a shell script for automating the process for building and
archiving a package of components for each platform.  The script
copies the waba code from ./CCProbe/bin/, the labbook from
./TeemssXML/LabBookXSL/, components from ./Packages/components/<platform>/,
documentation from .release/doc/<platform>/ and from
./Packages/doc/all/.  All of these elememts are copied to
./Packages/complete/<platform>/.  This folder contains what will be on
a users computer after downloading and expanding the archive.  Next
the directory ./Packages/complete/<platform> is archived in a platform
specific method with the result placed in
./Packages/download/<platform>/.  I use Stuffit Deluxe controlled from
Applescript order to create binhex stuffit archives for MacOS and
".exe" stuffit archives for windows.
