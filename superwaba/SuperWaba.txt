HI SUPERWABA FELLOWS!

   this is the first version of SuperWaba as a complete package
   for use in most handheld devices.

   use it carefully. please report bugs and different behaviour
   between all ports!

   since people are waiting, the documentation will be left to do after
   the release.

   i decided to send my hole waba directory, including my VisualCafe
   projects thats compiles the classes, the project to use in CodeWarrior
   for building the vm, some usefull files, like callhotsync.reg, that
   tells hotsync to install files in the next cradle button press, my
   make.bat file that builds the vm classes, a class named MethodsHash,
   that computes the hash code for creating native methods in the vm,
   among others. to look at them, you must search the directory structure.

   i hope that you will join us in helping the SuperWaba vm improve as 
   my friend Dave Slaughter did, in adding the support for appletviewer,
   windows CE and pocket PC.

   here are the modifications i remember that are added to the vms:

   . new class waba.util.Hashtable - acts like a hashtable, but uses
     strings as keys (instead of Objects)
   . appletviewer now reads and writes directly to pdb files, so you can
     easily debug your databases on a PC.
   . appletviewer correctly handles international chars.
   . appletviewer uses the f1-f10 keys to emulate the palm buttons
   . waba.lang.string now has a hashCode method

   keep looking at www.superwaba.org! and please don't hesitate
   to write docs and to help people at the pilot.programmer.waba
   newsgroup!

   enjoy!

        guich
           and
        Dave
