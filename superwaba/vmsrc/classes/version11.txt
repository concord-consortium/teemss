whats new in version 1.1

. Catalog 
  . new method inspectRecord(byte buf[], int recPosition) - the cursor is not advanced, neither the current record position. this method must be used only for a fast way of viewing the contents of a record, like searching for a specific header or filling a grid of data.
. keyboard 
  . new "done" button
  . corrected cursor disappearing on unpop
. Control
  . new constant FILL - fills the control to its parents width/height
  . new method setRect(Rect r) - for shortcut.
  . new method repaintNow() - paint the control immediately.
  . new method setVisible(boolean visible) - shows or "hides" this control. the "hide" works setting the control's size to zero. unhidding restores the original size. the Window class setVisible does nothing. you can change the controls size when hided if you want.
