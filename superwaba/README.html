<b>Waba Software Development Kit 1.0</b>
<p>
The WabaSDK allows you to develop Waba programs in conjunction with
a Java Development Kit such as Sun's JDK or Microsoft's SDK for Java.
<p>
The resulting programs can run on devices containing a Waba
Virtual Machine (WabaVM) and can run as a Java applet or application
on any machine supporting Java. WabaVM's for this release are
available for Windows CE and the PalmPilot.
<p>
<b>Changes from previous release</b>
<ul>
<li>removed Form dependencies under PalmOS
<li>allow multiple PalmOS catalogs w/same creator
<li>released source for bridge classes in SDK
<li>various internal-only code changes
</ul>
This release is fully backwards compatible with the Beta 9 release.
<p>
The class reference for this release is available
<a href="doc/index.html">here</a>.

<!--
A document explaining how to port Waba Beta 7 programs to the Beta 8 can be found
<a href="http://www.wabasoft.com/howto_port7to8.html">here</a>.
-->

<p>
<b>Instructions for using the SDK:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
You need a Java Development Kit to use this SDK. This could be
Sun's JDK, Microsoft's SDK for Java, Symantec's Visual Cafe, etc.
<p>
To create a Waba program, simply add the "classes" directory
contained in this distribution to your CLASSPATH and write your
program using the Waba classes.
<p>
Make sure not to use any language
features that are not supported by Waba (exceptions, threads, longs
or doubles) and reference only the Waba classes and the classes
you create in your program.
<p>
Do not reference any of the classes that
come as part of your JDK or your program will only run as a Java
applet or application and not on devices that only contain a WabaVM.
<p>
Refer to the "doc" directory for the complete Waba API. To remain
portable, the only classes you should use are those contained in
the Waba API.
<p>
You start creating a Waba program by subclassing the MainWindow class.
<p>
The Scribble example program shows how to create a basic Waba
program. The make.bat program contained in the Scribble directory
shows how to build the program. Under Windows, you can simply execute
"make" to build Scribble.
<p>
<li>
The Scribble example also shows how to run your program as a Java applet.
You can create a .html file, reference the waba.applet.Applet class in
the .html file and pass your MainWindow's name as the appClass parameter.
<p>
Refer to the Scribble example's .html file for an example.
<p>
<li>
To run your program on a PalmPilot or Windows CE device, a WabaVM must be
installed on the device. WabaVM's are available from the download page of
<a href="http://www.wabasoft.com">www.wabasoft.com</a>.
<p>
To install a Waba program on a PalmPilot, you will need to create .prc and .pdb
files. The .prc file is the PalmPilot executable and the .pdb file is
the PalmPilot database containing the class files for the program.
<p>
For Windows CE devices, you need to create .lnk and
.wrp files. The .lnk file is the Windows CE launch program and the .wrp
file contains the class files for the program.
<p>
You use the "exegen" program to generate .prc and .lnk files and the "warp" 
program to generate .pdb and .wrp files.
<p>
These programs are located in the "bin" directory and only run under Windows 95
and Windows NT. You can develop your program on any machine with a JDK but
you need to create the warp (.pdb and .wrp) and launch executables (.prc and
.lnk) on a Windows machine.
<p>
There are versions of these programs for other 
platforms, see the
<a href="http://www.wabasoft.com/top10.html">Top 10</a>
list on Wabasoft's web site for the other versions.
<p>
A more detailed explanation of how to use the exegen and warp programs to
generate these files is contained on Wabasoft's web site on the
<a href="http://www.wabasoft.com/howto_write.html">Writing a Simple Program</a>
page.
<p>
<li>
To install your program on a PalmPilot, simply install the .pdb and .prc
files for the program.
<p>
To install your program under Windows CE, simply install the .lnk and .wrp files.
<p>
Under Windows CE, you will need to install the .wrp file in the directory that
was specified when the .lnk shortcut file was created with exegen.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Examples</b>
<p>
This SDK contains a few example programs:
<ul>
<li> <b>AddrScan</b> <br> scans through the Address book of a PalmPilot
<li> <b>Controls</b> <br> displays some of the user-interface controls
<li> <b>CoreTest</b> <br> displays some of the core graphic functionality
<li> <b>ImageSplit</b> <br> example of image loading and manipulation
<li> <b>PocketWatch</b> <br> displays a running pocket watch
<li> <b>Scribble</b> <br> lets a user draw on the screen
<li> <b>Web</b> <br> displays the text of a web page - requires an Internet connection
</ul>
