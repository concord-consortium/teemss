CCProbe is an open-source application that is scriptable,
configurable, and supports probe-based visualization, analysis, and
calibration components. CCProbe also includes components for folders,
text, drawings, and images, which can be integrated with the probeware
to create curricular activities and a lab book portfolio in which work
can be saved and shared.  CCProbe has been specifically designed to
run well on handheld computers such as those running PalmOS or
Microsoft PocketPC. Written in Waba, an open source subset of Java
specifically designed for Handheld computers CCProbe is licensed under
the GPL and it runs on PalmOS, WinCE, PocketPC, Windows, MacOS, and
Unix.

<SNPARAGRAPH linkcolor="000F0F">What happens to a vehicle when there's very little friction?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Have you ever wondered why cars stay on the road when they round a corner? Why is it more difficult to round those corners when the road is wet or covered with ice? Besides the banking of the road, the tires provide a frictional surface against the surface of the road. The ideal car provides friction when you need it (turning and braking) but has little when you don't want it (speeding along in a straight line).</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>It's not that easy to make a vehicle move with almost no friction. But that's the goal of this investigation. We want a cart that's almost friction free so that we can study the forces on moving objects without being confused by the forces due to friction. Suppose a frictionless cart is pushed across the floor. How far do you think the cart will go? What forces will affect the motion of a frictionless cart? </SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>1. Center the SmartWheel in the slot so that it doesn't rub against the cardboard. Make it exactly parallel to the long edge of the cart. This will make the cart go straight. The aluminum arm goes against the same side of the cardboard as the straw. Mark two screw holes with a pencil or pen, one at each end.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. Make holes where the marks are, using a pencil or pen point. Enlarge the holes from both sides, until the screws fit snugly into them. The screws are provided with the SmartWheel.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>3. Put the screws first through the cardboard from the other side, and then screw them into the arm of the SmartWheel. Tighten them until the heads squeeze the cardboard a little bit. A paper clip will work as a screwdriver.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>2. To use the ramp, you will need to prop one end up with books. One simple way to measure the slope of the ramp is to give the ratio of the height of one end to the length. Thus, if the ramp end is raised 10cm and it is 1 meter long, its slope is about 1:10, or 10 percent. Don't raise it much more than this. The cart will go too fast!</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>HINT: How should you measure how far "up" the cart is when you release it? The distance along the ramp from its bottom edge to the rear wheels of the cart is a good measure.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH linkcolor="000F0F">What happens when two objects collide?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Collisions happen so fast that it's hard to see what was going on during the event. You just see the results of a smashed car or a home run or a sore hand. Sometimes you want big forces, as with a baseball bat or a karate chop, and sometimes you want to decrease the forces, as with a safety helmet.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>In this activity you will use the Force probe to actually measure what happens during a collision. How big are the forces? How long do they last? What features of the colliding objects make the forces bigger or smaller? How would you increase or decrease the forces during a collision? </SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>1. In Trials I and II, the cart has two forms of energy. The first, gravitational potential energy, is proportional to an object's height above the Earth. The higher an object, the more gravitational potential energy it has. When did the cart have the greatest potential energy? Why? </SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<EMBOBJ object="Potential_Kinetic_Energy_analysis_80_1" link="true" linkcolor="FF0000"/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. The second form is kinetic energy, also called energy of motion. It depends on an object's velocity. When did the cart have the greatest kinetic energy? Why? </SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<EMBOBJ object="Potential_Kinetic_Energy_analysis_81_2" link="true" linkcolor="FF0000"/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>3.  Do you think the cart has as much kinetic energy at the bottom of the ramp as it had potential energy at the top of the ramp? Why? </SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<EMBOBJ object="Potential_Kinetic_Energy_analysis_82_3" link="true" linkcolor="FF0000"/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>4. Energy can also be stored in a stretched rubber band. It's another form of potential energy. If you "hang" a cart down a ramp with a rubber band, then let it bounce up and down, energy is going from (gravitational potential) to (kinetic) to (rubber band potential). Look at your data from Trial III. Draw the graph. Where on the graph is each kind of energy the greatest? </SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<EMBOBJ object="Potential_Kinetic_Energy_analysis_83_4" link="true" linkcolor="FF0000"/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>5. After the cart leaves the ramp, it slows down, losing its kinetic energy. Where does the energy go? </SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<EMBOBJ object="Potential_Kinetic_Energy_analysis_84_5" link="true" linkcolor="FF0000"/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>6. We often want to store energy for later use. The useful energy might not always be kinetic energy - it might be light from a bulb, or heat in a room. How many examples of this can you list? List the form of stored energy and the form of useful energy that comes from it. </SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>When electricity flows through a wire, some of its energy goes into heating up the wire. Sometimes this is a problem. When electricity travels from a power station to the city, heat energy is wasted. But once the electricity arrives at your house for the purpose of heating a stove or a room, electrical heating is very efficient and flexible. What devices in your house use electricity for heating? </SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>The Genecon is a little generator with the same basic design as the huge generators run by hydroelectric dams, coal-fired boilers, or nuclear power plants. In every case, some other form of energy (e.g., falling water, burning coal, decaying radioactive material) turns the "crank" of a generator and creates electrical power. In this case, you supply the power. Think of several ways that electric power is generated and the source of energy in each case. </SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Energy comes in many forms - electrical, mechanical, chemical, light, nuclear - and it can be stored in many ways - batteries, springs, water towers, gasoline, radioactive materials. To make use of energy, we often want to change it from one form to another, then store it, then transform it again and use it later on.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>How many kinds of energy can you think of that you make use of in and around yourhouse? Where does each kind come from? How is it stored before you use it? Is it changed from one form to another when you make use of it? What do you do with the energy? On your handheld, answer these questions for each kind of energy.</SNPARAGRAPH>

A very small amount of energy is released so fast that it makes a bright, but brief, light. This is just what a camera needs! But when you want a slow, steady supply of energy, as with the air cart motor, a capacitor is not the best source of energy. A battery is much better.

<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>We use many devices that transform energy from one form to another. Sometimes a whole chain of transformations takes place. They often do it so smoothly that we don't even realize what's happening. Each step usually involves some loss of useful energy. An automobile engine, for instance, is only 30 per cent efficient.
