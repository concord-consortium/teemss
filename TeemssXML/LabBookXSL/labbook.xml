<SNPARAGRAPH linkcolor="000F0F">What happens to a vehicle when there's very little friction?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Have you ever wondered why cars stay on the road when they round a corner? Why is it more difficult to round those corners when the road is wet or covered with ice? Besides the banking of the road (which we will learn about later), the tires provide a frictional surface against the surface of the road. The ideal car provides friction when you need it (turning and braking) but has little when you don't want it (speeding along in a straight line).</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>It's not that easy to make a vehicle move with almost no friction. But that's the goal of this investigation. We want a cart that's almost friction free so that we can study the forces on moving objects without being confused by the forces due to friction. If a frictionless cart, for example, is pushed across the floor, how far do you think the cart will go? In your group, predict and explain how different forces will affect the motion of a frictionless cart. Write in Notes on your handheld computer your ideas about what might explain your prediction(s). Refer to Technical Hints to see how to use the software.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH/>
            <SNPARAGRAPH>1. Center the SmartWheel in the slot so that it doesn't rub against the cardboard. Make it exactly parallel to the long edge of the cart. This will make the cart go straight. The aluminum arm goes against the same side of the cardboard as the straw. Mark two screw holes with a pencil or pen, one at each end.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. Make holes where the marks are, using a pencil or pen point. Enlarge the holes from both sides, until the screws fit snugly into them. The screws are provided with the SmartWheel.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>3. Put the screws through the cardboard from the other side, and screw them into the arm of the SmartWheel. Tighten them until the heads squeeze the cardboard a little bit. A paper clip will work as a screwdriver.</SNPARAGRAPH>

          <SNPARAGRAPH>2. To use the ramp, you will need to prop one end up with books. One simple way to measure the slope of the ramp is to give the ratio of the height of one end to the length. Thus, if the ramp end is raised 10cm and it is 1 meter long, its slope is about 1:10, or 10 percent. Don't raise it much more than this. The cart will go too fast!</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>HINT: How should you measure how far "up" the cart is when you release it? The distance along the ramp from its bottom edge to the rear wheels of the cart is a good measure.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH linkcolor="000F0F">What happens when two objects collide?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>In this activity you will use the Force probe to actually measure what happens during a collision. How big are the forces? How long do they last? What features of the colliding objects make the forces bigger or smaller? In your group, explain how you would increase or decrease the forces during a collision. Write or draw in Notes on your handheld computer your ideas about how to do this.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>4. If a light cart hit a heavy cart at rest, what would you say now about the force on each one and their speeds after the collision?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>5. Newton's Second Law asserts that a force is needed to change the velocity of an object. The greater the force, the more quickly the velocity changes. Do your trials support this theory?</SNPARAGRAPH>

	<SNPARAGRAPH>1. In Trials I and II, the cart has two forms of energy. The first, gravitational potential energy, is proportional to an object's height above the Earth. The higher an object, the more gravitational potential energy it has. When in each trial did the cart have the greatest potential energy? Why?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. The second form is kinetic energy, also called energy of motion. It depends on an object's velocity. When in each trial did the cart have the greatest kinetic energy? Why?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>3. Do you think the cart has as much kinetic energy at the bottom of the ramp as it had potential energy at the top of the ramp? Why?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>4. Energy can also be stored in a stretched rubber band. It's another form of potential energy. If you "hang" a cart down a ramp with a rubber band, then let it bounce up and down, energy is going from (gravitational potential) to (kinetic) to (rubber band potential). Look at your data from Trial III. Where on the graph is each kind of energy the greatest?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>5. After the cart leaves the ramp, it slows down, losing its kinetic energy. Where does the energy go?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>6. We often want to store energy for later use. How many examples of this can you list? In each case, what is the form of stored energy, and what is the form of useful energy that comes from it? Hint: The useful energy might not always be kinetic energy; it might be light from a bulb, or heat in a room.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>The Genecon is a little generator with the same basic design as the huge generators run by hydroelectric dams, coal-fired boilers, or nuclear power plants. In every case, some other form of energy (e.g., falling water, burning coal, decaying radioactive material) turns the "crank" of a generator and creates electrical power. In this case, you supply the power. Make a list in Notes on your handheld computer of several ways that electric power is generated and the source of energy in each case.</SNPARAGRAPH>

	<SNPARAGRAPH>1. When you charged the capacitor with the Genecon, then ran the Genecon with the capacitor, do you think you obtained as much mechanical energy out of the capacitor as you put in it? How could you find out? If you didn't, where did the energy go?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. Capacitors, with their ability to store electrical energy and release it very fast, have many uses. A familiar one is the flash on a camera. A very small amount of energy is released so fast that it makes a bright, but brief, light. This is just what a camera needs! But when you want a slow, steady supply of energy, as with the air cart motor, a capacitor is not the best source of energy. A battery is much better. Think of other situations that use batteries and capacitors for electrical energy storage.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>3. The Fresnel lens concentrates light from a larger area to a smaller area, by bending the light that comes through it. This is called refraction. How much do you think the Fresnel lens magnified the amount of sunlight reaching the heat cell compared to just letting it sit out in the Sun without the lens? Compare the area of the Fresnel lens to the area of the focused light on the heat cell.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>4. How many devices can you think of that use lenses to focus light?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>5. How do you think sunlight is converted into heat? Do you think it matters if the heat cell is black instead of plain aluminum? Can heat be converted back into light? If so, list some examples of this type of conversion.</SNPARAGRAPH>
