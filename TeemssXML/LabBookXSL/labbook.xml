CCProbe is an open-source application that is scriptable,
configurable, and supports probe-based visualization, analysis, and
calibration components. CCProbe also includes components for folders,
text, drawings, and images, which can be integrated with the probeware
to create curricular activities and a lab book portfolio in which work
can be saved and shared.  CCProbe has been specifically designed to
run well on handheld computers such as those running PalmOS or
Microsoft PocketPC. Written in Waba, an open source subset of Java
specifically designed for Handheld computers CCProbe is licensed under
the GPL and it runs on PalmOS, WinCE, PocketPC, Windows, MacOS, and
Unix.

<SNPARAGRAPH linkcolor="000F0F">What happens to a vehicle when there's very little friction?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Have you ever wondered why cars stay on the road when they round a corner? Why is it more difficult to round those corners when the road is wet or covered with ice? Besides the banking of the road, the tires provide a frictional surface against the surface of the road. The ideal car provides friction when you need it (turning and braking) but has little when you don't want it (speeding along in a straight line).</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>It's not that easy to make a vehicle move with almost no friction. But that's the goal of this investigation. We want a cart that's almost friction free so that we can study the forces on moving objects without being confused by the forces due to friction. Suppose a frictionless cart is pushed across the floor.How far do you think the cart will go? What forces will affect the motion of a frictionless cart? </SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>1. You will need to build a ramp to provide your cart an equal start, again and again.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Cut a piece of cardboard about 1m long and at least 30cm wide.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Mark two lines 5cm from each side of the cardboard.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Along the two lines, fold the cardboard into a "U" to make the edges stiff and keep the cart from running off the edge.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Then the cardboard ramp rests easily on a flat surface.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>2. To use the ramp, you will need to prop one end up with books. One simple way to measure the slope of the ramp is to give the ratio of the height of one end to the length. Thus, if the ramp end is raised 10cm and it is 1 meter long, its slope is about 1:10, or 10 percent. Don't raise it much more than this. The cart will go too fast!</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>HINT: How should you measure how far "up" the cart is when you release it? The distance along the ramp from its bottom edge to the rear wheels of the cart is a good measure.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH linkcolor="000F0F">What happens when two objects collide?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Collisions happen so fast that it's hard to see what was going on during the event. You just see the results of a smashed car or a home run or a sore hand. Sometimes you want big forces, as with a baseball bat or a karate chop, and sometimes you want to decrease the forces, as with a safety helmet.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>In this activity you will use the Force probe to actually measure what happens during a collision. How big are the forces? How long do they last? What features of the colliding objects make the forces bigger or smaller?How would you increase or decrease the forces during a collision? </SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>We are constantly dealing with things at different temperatures. Sometimes we want the heat to flow faster (cooking) and sometimes we want to prevent its flow (sleeping bags).

<SNPARAGRAPH>1. In Trials I and II, the cart has two forms of energy. The first, gravitational potential energy, is proportional to an object's height above the Earth. The higher an object, the more gravitational potential energy it has. When in each trial did the cart have the greatest potential energy? Why?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. The second form is kinetic energy, also called energy of motion. It depends on an object's velocity. When in each trial did the cart have the greatest kinetic energy? Why?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>3. Do you think the cart has as much kinetic energy at the bottom of the ramp as it had potential energy at the top of the ramp? Why?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>4. Energy can also be stored in a stretched rubber band. It's another form of potential energy. If you "hang" a cart down a ramp with a rubber band, then let it bounce up and down, energy is going from (gravitational potential) to (kinetic) to (rubber band potential). Look at your data from Trial III. Where on the graph is each kind of energy the greatest?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>5. After the cart leaves the ramp, it slows down, losing its kinetic energy. Where does the energy go?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>6. We often want to store energy for later use. How many examples of this can you list? In each case, what is the form of stored energy, and what is the form of useful energy that comes from it?

<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>When electricity flows through a wire, some of its energy goes into heating up the wire. Sometimes this is a problem. When electricity travels from a power station to the city, heat energy is wasted. But once the electricity arrives at your house for the purpose of heating a stove or a room, electrical heating is very efficient and flexible.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>The Genecon is a little generator with the same basic design as the huge generators run by hydroelectric dams, coal-fired boilers, or nuclear power plants. In every case, some other form of energy (e.g., falling water, burning coal, decaying radioactive material) turns the "crank" of a generator and creates electrical power. In this case, you supply the power. Make a list in Notes on your handheld computer of several ways that electric power is generated and the source of energy in each case.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>1. When you charged the capacitor with the Genecon, then ran the Genecon with the capacitor, do you think you obtained as much mechanical energy out of the capacitor as you put in it? How could you find out? If you didn't, where did the energy go?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. Capacitors, with their ability to store electrical energy and release it very fast, have many uses. A familiar one is the flash on a camera. A very small amount of energy is released so fast that it makes a bright, but brief, light. This is just what a camera needs! But when you want a slow, steady supply of energy, as with the air cart motor, a capacitor is not the best source of energy. A battery is much better. Think of other situations that use batteries and capacitors for electrical energy storage.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>3. The Fresnel lens concentrates light from a larger area to a smaller area, by bending the light that comes through it. This is called refraction.

<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH linkcolor="000F0F">What energy transformations are used in everyday devices?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>We use many devices that transform energy from one form to another. Sometimes a whole chain of transformations takes place. They often do it so smoothly that we don't even realize what's happening. Each step usually involves some loss of useful energy. An automobile engine, for instance, is only 30 per cent efficient. That is, only 30 percent of the available energy in gasoline is available to move the car.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Think of some examples where energy is transformed several times before it is used. In your handheld Notes, list each of the forms of energy in the chain, and what you think the efficiency is for each step. Where do you think the wasted energy goes?</SNPARAGRAPH>
