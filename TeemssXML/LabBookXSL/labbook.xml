<SNPARAGRAPH>
CCProbe is an open-source application that is scriptable,
configurable, and supports probe-based visualization, analysis, and
calibration components. CCProbe also includes components for folders,
text, drawings, and images, which can be integrated with the probeware
to create curricular activities and a lab book portfolio in which work
can be saved and shared.  CCProbe has been specifically designed to
run well on handheld computers such as those running PalmOS or
Microsoft PocketPC. Written in Waba, an open source subset of Java
specifically designed for Handheld computers CCProbe is licensed under
the GPL and it runs on PalmOS, WinCE, PocketPC, Windows, MacOS, and
Unix.

<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>Have you ever wondered why cars stay on the road when they round a corner? Why is it more difficult to round those corners when the road is wet or covered with ice? Besides the banking of the road, the tires provide a frictional surface against the surface of the road. The ideal car provides friction when you need it (turning and braking) but has little when you don't want it (speeding along in a straight line).</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>1. Center the SmartWheel in the slot so that it doesn't rub against the cardboard. Make it exactly parallel to the long edge of the cart. This will make the cart go straight. The aluminum arm goes against the same side of the cardboard as the straw. Mark two screw holes with a pencil or pen, one at each end.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. Make holes where the marks are, using a pencil or pen point. Enlarge the holes from both sides, until the screws fit snugly into them. The screws are provided with the SmartWheel.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>3. Put the screws first through the cardboard from the other side, and then screw them into the arm of the SmartWheel. Tighten them until the heads squeeze the cardboard a little bit. A paper clip will work as a screwdriver.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>4. Now the SmartWheel is in place. It can be taken on and off. You will need to do this for the Tracker Investigation.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>2. To use the ramp, you will need to prop one end up with books. One simple way to measure the slope of the ramp is to give the ratio of the height of one end to the length. Thus, if the ramp end is raised 10cm and it is 1 meter long, its slope is about 1:10, or 10 percent. Don't raise it much more than this. The cart will go too fast!</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>HINT: How should you measure how far "up" the cart is when you release it? The distance along the ramp from its bottom edge to the rear wheels of the cart is a good measure.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH/>Trials I and II are examples of Newton
              's famous assertion that "for every action,
              there is an equal and opposite reaction." Does
                it seem to be true in both cases?Is
                the result surprising?  If
                you were pushing on each other with Force probes instead
                of pulling, would they still read the same?"  If
                one of the Force probes were attached to a wall and you
                were pulling on the other one, would they read the same
                force?   If a
                light cart hit a heavy cart at rest, what would you say
                now about the force on each one and their speeds after
                the collision?Newton's Second Law asserts that a
              force is needed to change the velocity of an object. The
              greater the force, the more quickly the velocity changes. Describe an experiment to test this
                theory. </SUPERNOTES>

<SNPARAGRAPH>1. In Trials I and II, the cart has two forms of energy. The first, gravitational potential energy, is proportional to an object's height above the Earth. The higher an object, the more gravitational potential energy it has. When in each trial did the cart have the greatest potential energy? Why?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. The second form is kinetic energy, also called energy of motion. It depends on an object's velocity. When in each trial did the cart have the greatest kinetic energy? Why?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>3. Do you think the cart has as much kinetic energy at the bottom of the ramp as it had potential energy at the top of the ramp? Why?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>4. Energy can also be stored in a stretched rubber band. It's another form of potential energy. If you "hang" a cart down a ramp with a rubber band, then let it bounce up and down, energy is going from (gravitational potential) to (kinetic) to (rubber band potential). Look at your data from Trial III. Where on the graph is each kind of energy the greatest?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>5. After the cart leaves the ramp, it slows down, losing its kinetic energy. Where does the energy go?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>6. We often want to store energy for later use. How many examples of this can you list? In each case, what is the form of stored energy, and what is the form of useful energy that comes from it? Hint: The useful energy might not always be kinetic energy; it might be light from a bulb, or heat in a room.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>The Genecon is a little generator with the same basic design as the huge generators run by hydroelectric dams, coal-fired boilers, or nuclear power plants. In every case, some other form of energy (e.g., falling water, burning coal, decaying radioactive material) turns the "crank" of a generator and creates electrical power. In this case, you supply the power. Make a list in Notes on your handheld computer of several ways that electric power is generated and the source of energy in each case.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>1. Discuss the shape of the temperature graph when you supplied electrical energy to the heat cell with the Genecon. Does it start to heat right away? What does the slope of the line tell you? Is it the same for fast and slow cranking?</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>2. Compare the rate of heating by the Genecon and the batteries. Which heats faster? How can you tell? Are you surprised by the amount of cranking it takes to equal what a small battery can do?</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>1. When you charged the capacitor with the Genecon, then ran the Genecon with the capacitor, do you think you obtained as much mechanical energy out of the capacitor as you put in it? How could you find out? If you didn't, where did the energy go?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. Capacitors, with their ability to store electrical energy and release it very fast, have many uses. A familiar one is the flash on a camera. A very small amount of energy is released so fast that it makes a bright, but brief, light. This is just what a camera needs! But when you want a slow, steady supply of energy, as with the air cart motor, a capacitor is not the best source of energy. A battery is much better. Think of other situations that use batteries and capacitors for electrical energy storage.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>3. The Fresnel lens concentrates light from a larger area to a smaller area, by bending the light that comes through it. This is called refraction. How much do you think the Fresnel lens magnified the amount of sunlight reaching the heat cell compared to just letting it sit out in the Sun without the lens? Compare the area of the Fresnel lens to the area of the focused light on the heat cell.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>11. Crank the other Genecon to lift the weight. Can you also lower the weight? If the weight is heavy enough, will it fall by itself? Try different things, like raising and lowering slowly and quickly. Record the order in which you did things so that you can relate them to your graph in Notes on your handheld computer.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>12. Save your data to your handheld computer.</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>13. What series of energy transformations is happening here? What do you think the efficiency of this system is? Record your thoughts in Notes on your handheld computer.</SNPARAGRAPH>

<SNPARAGRAPH>1. You built a solar car in Trial I! What other features would it need to be a practical vehicle?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>2. Open the data from Trials II. Compare all of the different light levels you measured. What was the maximum level? What was the minimum level?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>3. You were asked to rate the efficiency of each energy transformation. Low efficiency means that useful energy is lost. Where does the lost energy go, in the case of the Genecon, the solar cell, and the light bulb?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>4. Open the data from Trial III. Compare the energy graph with your list of what you were doing with the two Genecons and the attached mass. What does the graph tell you about energy transfer from one Genecon to the other?</SNPARAGRAPH>
<SNPARAGRAPH/>
<SNPARAGRAPH>5. Design an energy "Rube Goldberg" machine. This type of machine is a wacky series of devices that change energy through various forms and ends up serving a purpose. Make a drawing of your Rube Goldberg on your handheld computer. Refer to Technical Hints to see draw in the software. Please no live animals!</SNPARAGRAPH>
