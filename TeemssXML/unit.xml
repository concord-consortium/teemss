    <skill name="describe motion">knowing that an object&apos;s motion
      can be described by tracing and measuring its position over time;  </skill>
    <skill name="balanced forces">understanding effects of balanced and
      unbalanced forces on an object&apos;s motion (e.g., if more than
      one force acts on an object along a straight line then the forces
      will reinforce or cancel one another, depending on their direction
      and magnitude; unbalanced forces such as friction will cause
      changes in the speed or direction on an object&apos;s motion);  </skill>
    <skill name="answering a question">knowing that scientific
      investigations involve asking and answering a question;  </skill>
    <skill name="planning and conducting">planning and conducting simple
      investigations (e.g., formulating hypotheses, designing and
      executing investigations, interprets data, synthesizing evidence
      into explanations, proposing alternative explanations for
      observations, critiquing explanations and procedures);  </skill>
    <skill name="establishing relationships">establishing relationships
      based on evidence and logical argument (e.g., provides causes for
      effects);  </skill>
    <skill name="evaluating results">knowing that scientific inquiry
      includes evaluating results of scientific investigations,
      experiments, observations, theoretical and mathematical models,
      and explanations proposed by other scientists (e.g., reviewing
      experimental procedures, examining evidence, identifying faulty
      reasoning, identifying statements that go beyond the evidence,
      suggesting alternative explanations).  </skill>
    <skill name="variables">identifying variables that can affect the
      outcome of an experiment;  </skill>

      an object, the object either speeds up, slows down, or goes in a
      different direction;  </skill>
    <skill name="strength force">understanding the relationship between
      the strength of a force and its effect on an object (e.g., the
      greater the force, the greater the change in motion; the more
      massive the object, the smaller the effect of a given force);  </skill>

        <steps>
          <step>Center the SmartWheel in the slot so that it
            doesn&apos;t rub against the cardboard. Make it exactly
            parallel to the long edge of the cart. This will make the

            underside of the cardboard, the same as the straw. Mark two
            screw holes with a pencil or pen, one at each end.  </step>
          <step>Make holes where the marks are, using a pencil or pen
            point. Enlarge the holes from both sides, until the screws
            fit snugly into them. The screws are provided with the SmartWheel.</step>
          <step>Put the screws first through the cardboard from the
            other side, and then screw them into the arm of the
            SmartWheel. Tighten them until the heads squeeze the

        <steps>
          <step>The Voltage/Current Probe measures either voltage or
            current. It can also measure both at the same time. The
            CCProbe software can use these readings to calculate and
            display power (watts) and energy (joules).  <shared-image
              name="07_VIProbe" screenshot="false"/>
          </step>
          <step>Voltage difference is measured in volts (V). The red
            clip lead goes to the positive (+) place, and the black clip
            lead goes to the negative (-) place. Here is how to measure
            voltage between two ends of a heat cell attached to a
            battery:  <shared-image name="01_vi" screenshot="false"/>
          </step>
          <step>To measure the current in a wire, you have to break the
            wire and force the current to go through your current probe.
            The convention is that current is positive when it flows
            from a positive to a negative voltage, that is, from red to
            black. For the current through the probe to be positive, it
            should flow into the yellow clip lead and out of the green
            clip lead. Here is how to measure current going through a
            heat cell attached to a battery. Current is measured in
            amperes (A).  <shared-image name="02_vi" screenshot="false"/>
          </step>
          <step>Electrical power, the rate of using energy, is voltage
            difference times current. It can be pictured as the number
            of electrons flowing per second, multiplied by the energy
            each one loses. Power is measured in watts (W).  </step>
          <step>Electrical energy is the power accumulated over time. It
            can be pictured as the total number of electrons that flow,
            multiplied by the energy that each one gains (or loses).
            Energy is measured in joules (J).   </step>
          <step>To measure the power or energy, you must measure both
            voltage and current. Here is how to measure current going
            through a heat cell attached to a battery.  <shared-image
              name="03_vi" screenshot="false"/>
          </step>
          <step>The CCProbeware will calculate and display the power or
            energy from these measurements.  </step>

        <teacher-discuss>
          <teacher-overview>This investigation is important because
            students build a low-friction cart and ramp that will be
            needed later. Most of this investigation is devoted to
            construction and testing. This can be most absorbing, but to
            get the most out of the time, you should encourage students
            to think about the goal of friction reduction and how the
            cart design achieves this. <p>Students get confused about
              the effects of forces because friction is present in most
              situations they encounter. Students do not understand that
              forces cause a change in velocity, since everyday
              experiences suggest to them that forces are needed just to
              keep velocity constant.  </p>
            <p>An example of this comes from biking on a level road,
              where it is obvious that one has to work hard providing a
              force just to keep going at a steady rate. Does this show
              that force does not change velocity? No, because there is
              no net force on the bike. At constant speed, the force of
              friction exactly balances the force the biker supplies. If
              there were no friction from the air, bike, and road, then
              no force would be needed, but students usually do not
              realize this. What actually causes friction at a molecular
              level is a very complicated subject, still not perfectly
              understood. More important at the beginning level is the
              idea that friction is a force that opposes motion. The
              friction force always acts to slow down a moving object.  </p>
          </teacher-overview>
          <teacher-stage>Before beginning the construction, engage
            students in a conversation about friction. A good first
            discussion can be about what it would be like to exist in a
            world without friction. Here are some questions you might
            ask, followed by possible responses. <teacher-questions>
              <question>When have you experienced very low friction?</question>
              <answer>Roller-skating, ice skating, skateboarding. Not swimming</answer>
              <question>What would it be like if every surface was
                covered by slippery ice?</question>
              <answer>It would be hard to stand up. Going down stairs
                would be very dangerous--hanging on the banister would
                not help much because your hands would slip, too.</answer>
              <question>Would your bike work in a frictionless world?</question>
              <answer>No. You couldn&apos;t start because the wheel
                would slip. You couldn&apos;t turn without falling over.</answer>
              <question>If you were in a four-wheel wagon, how would you
                get going?</question>
              <answer>Pushing with your foot against the ground
                wouldn&apos;t work. Pushing against a heavy or fixed
                object would work.</answer>
              <question>If low friction situations are unusual, why
                study them?</question>
              <answer>Friction confuses the situation. Motion is easier
                to understand without friction. We can always add
                friction later.</answer>
            </teacher-questions>
          </teacher-stage>
          <teacher-wrap>If students investigate the effect of mass, they
            might be in for a surprise. It is natural to assume that the
            heavier cart will zoom down the ramp faster. Ask students: <teacher-questions>
              <question>Is there more force down the ramp on the more
                massive cart?</question>
              <answer>Yes. This can be perceived by simply feeling the
                force on a stationary cart. </answer>
              <question>If the force is greater, why doesn&apos;t the
                heavy cart move faster?</question>
              <answer>The greater force down the ramp is exactly
                balanced by the increased force needed to move the
                heavier cart. This is the same effect as the famous but
                apocryphal story about dropping heavy and light balls
                off the Leaning Tower of Pisa. </answer>
            </teacher-questions>
            <p>To focus students on the role of friction, ask them to
              design high-friction carts. How many ways could they
              design a cart that would roll down the ramp but stop
              within one cart length? </p>
          </teacher-wrap>
        </teacher-discuss>
        <teacher-background> The energy lost to friction always ends up
          as heat energy in the form of random molecular motion. This
          will come up in later investigations, when the question
          &quot;where did the energy go?&quot; will be asked again and
          again. There can be many sources of friction. In the case of
          the cart, the axle rubs in the straw when it turns. There is
          some rolling friction as the wheel surface touches and then
          lifts from the floor. This is much less than if the wheels
          were locked and dragged across the floor, however! That&apos;s
          why car brakes work: when the wheel is braked, it is dragged
          along the road instead of being free to roll. It&apos;s also
          why you can steer: it&apos;s easier for a wheel to roll in the
          direction it&apos;s steered than to slide sideways, so the car
          tends to go in that direction, unless the road is icy. <p>A
            distinction can be made between starting or static friction
            (the force between surfaces before the object moves), and
            sliding or kinetic friction (which is the force between
            surfaces as the object slides along). These could be
            measured with the Force probe as an extension activity. For
            instance, one could put a loop of string through a book and
            pull it across a table. The static friction would be the
            force needed just to get the object moving, and the kinetic
            friction would be the force needed to keep it moving at a
            constant speed. Kinetic friction is roughly constant
            regardless of how fast the object is sliding.  </p>
          <p>Students should also consider the effect of air resistance
            that results from the cart hitting air molecules and pushing
            them out of the way when it is moving. A wind tunnel
            isolates the effect of air resistance. Air resistance
            increases with increased velocity, so the force needed to
            keep a car going at 60km/hr is much greater than for
            20km/hr.  </p>

          banking of the road, the tires provide a frictional surface
          against the surface of the road. The ideal car provides
          friction when you need it (turning and braking) but has little

        <steps>
          <step>You will need to build a ramp to provide your cart an
            equal start, again and again.  <steps>
              <step>Cut a piece of cardboard about 1m long and at least
                30cm wide. </step>
              <step>Mark two lines 5cm from each side of the cardboard.  </step>
              <step>Along the two lines, fold the cardboard into a
                &quot;U&quot; to make the edges stiff and keep the cart
                from running off the edge. </step>
              <step>Then the cardboard ramp rests easily on a flat surface.<ext-image-sequence>

          </step>
          <step>To use the ramp, you will need to prop one end up with
            books. One simple way to measure the slope of the ramp is to
            give the ratio of the height of one end to the length. Thus,
            if the ramp end is raised 10cm and it is 1 meter long, its
            slope is about 1:10, or 10 percent. Don&apos;t raise it much
            more than this. The cart will go too fast!<p>HINT: How
              should you measure how far &quot;up&quot; the cart is when
              you release it? The distance along the ramp from its
              bottom edge to the rear wheels of the cart is a good
              measure.  </p>

        <teacher-discuss>
          <teacher-overview>While students need not understand the
            electronics, they need an operational understanding of what
            is going on to interpret the resulting graphs. You can do
            this by focusing student attention on the sensor and
            &quot;playing&quot; with the sensor to see what graphs can
            be produced.  <p>Ask students to look carefully at the
              SmartWheel and come up with theories about how it works.
              Research has clearly shown that students should get a feel
              for graphs of their own motion before using the detector
              in an experiment. This is why the first trial involves
              walking with the detector, the second uses a cart kids
              pull, and the third involves a cart that moves on its own.
              That sequence should help students connect their
              kinesthetic experiences to the motion of the cart. Focus
              student thinking on the relationship between the motion
              and its graph. Give them practice predicting one and
              viewing the other. Once they make a measurement, be sure
              students review their prediction and think about what
              aspects of the prediction were right or wrong. Make a game
              of making accurate predictions.  </p>
          </teacher-overview>
          <teacher-stage>A way to build understanding is to describe a
            motion and have students predict in advance what graph they
            will observe. A description might be &quot;Your cart moves
            forward slowly until it has gone one meter. Then it stops
            for five seconds and roars backward quickly for two
            meters.&quot; Have students predict by sketching a graph on
            paper before doing the experiment. Then have them reflect on
            the differences between their predictions and observations.
            Their sketches won&apos;t be exact, but did they capture the
            main features?  <p>Debating this helps students think about
              what the main features are. The particular motion
              described above introduces the idea of negative distance,
              something that students can find difficult. The end point
              of this motion is minus one meter and appears on the graph
              below the horizontal axis. Be sure to point this out.
              Continue to invent other situations that involve negative
              distance until students are comfortable with this idea.  </p>
          </teacher-stage>
          <teacher-wrap>At the end of the trials, focus student
            attention again on the relationship between motion and its
            graph. Following are some ways to do this. Sketch a graph
            that all students can see, or use a projector so everyone
            can see a graph that you make. Then challenge each group to
            reproduce this graph by moving the cart by hand. This helps
            students connect the nature of the motion with the features
            on the graph. Ask students to identify what kind of motion
            resulted in each feature of the graph; each straight
            section, kink, peak, and valley. Ask what motion would
            result in steeply rising or falling sections, and how to
            create a graph with a continuously increasing or decreasing
            slope. A few minutes at this can do wonders for student
            ability to analyze graphs.  <p>Challenge students to
              describe the difference between a rising and falling
              straight section of the graph that have the same angle.
              One represents a constant speed forward and the other the
              same speed backward. Scientists have introduced the term
              &quot;velocity&quot; just to cover both these situations.
              Velocity and speed are the same when the cart goes
              forward, but velocity is negative for the same speed
              backward. So, that line sloping downward is negative
              velocity. Try to get students to drop &quot;speed&quot; in
              favor of &quot;velocity&quot;. The critical difference is
              that speed is always positive so it cannot distinguish
              between forward and backward motion. Velocity is better
              because backward motion is negative velocity.</p>
            <p>The important velocity graph is introduced in the third
              trial. Focus student attention on this by sketching a
              position graph and having students predict the velocity
              graph. This is easy once you realize that the velocity is
              how fast the distance changes, so it depends on the slope
              of the position graph. If students don&apos;t agree on the
              velocity graph, have them do the experiment. Generate a
              position graph that approximates your sketch and use the
              computer to draw its velocity graph.</p>

        <teacher-background>This investigation introduces the SmartWheel
          as a tool for exploring how to measure motion. The motion of
          an object is where it is, how fast it&apos;s moving, and in
          what direction - that is, its position and its velocity. The
          SmartWheel measures how many times the wheel turns and how
          fast it&apos;s turning. If it&apos;s running along the ground,
          these measurements can be converted into distance and speed.
          Are these the same as position and velocity? This question
          raises basic and challenging issues.   <p>The SmartWheel, like
            a car&apos;s odometer, measures the distance the wheel has
            traveled along the ground. Unlike the odometer, however, the
            SmartWheel will subtract distance if it rotates in reverse.
            If the SmartWheel is run along a straight line, the position
            measurement will increase if you go in one direction and
            decrease if you go in the other, whereas the distance you
            traveled will always increase. If you go 10km in a car and
            then turn around and go back to where you began, you will
            have gone a distance of 20km, but your position will
            increase to 10km then back down to 0m. Position can be
            either positive or negative. In simple terms, distance is
            how far you travel, and position is where you are at each
            instant relative to your starting point. Here&apos;s an
            example of going in one direction, stopping and then
            returning to the starting location.   </p>
          <shared-image name="23_th_posfdbk" screenshot="true"/>
          <p>A similar distinction can be made between speed and
            velocity. Speed is how fast you&apos;re going (change in
            distance / change in time), regardless of what direction
            you&apos;re going. A car&apos;s speedometer measures speed.
            Velocity, however, has two parts: speed and direction.
            &quot;Driving north at 30km/hr&quot; is a velocity, and
            it&apos;s different from &quot;driving west at 30km/hr.
            &quot; In the above example, the velocity is positive as you
            go forward and your position increases. It&apos;s zero when
            you stop. Then it&apos;s negative as you go backward and
            your position decreases.   </p>
          <shared-image name="24_th_velfdbk" screenshot="true"/>
          <p>If your cart bounces off a wall, it might have similar
            speeds before and after the bounce, but its velocity has
            reversed direction. This will be shown on the SmartWheel
            graph as a positive velocity before the collision and a
            negative velocity afterwards. The position graph will
            increase, then decrease as the cart rolls backwards.   </p>
          <shared-image name="26_th_velbounce" screenshot="true"/>
          <p>When the SmartWheel is used for one-dimensional motion
            along a straight line, position can be thought of as the
            distance, positive or negative, from the starting point.
            Velocity can be thought of as either positive or negative
            speed, where positive velocity increases position, and
            negative velocity decreases position.   </p>
          <shared-image name="25_th_posbounce" screenshot="true"/>
          <p>Motion in two or three dimensions, such a circular motion,
            is not explored in these Investigations. It may come up,
            however. For example, suppose you&apos;re driving a car in a
            circle at 30km/hr. Your distance from the center and your
            speed are both constant. But your position is certainly
            changing, and your velocity is changing because your
            direction of travel is not constant.   </p>
          <p>A central challenge for students is to understand the
            relationship between a position graph and a velocity graph
            for the same motion. Since velocity is change in position
            divided by change in time, velocity is the slope of the
            position versus time graph. For instance, a steadily rising
            straight-line position graph is equivalent to a level and
            positive velocity graph. A steadily falling straight-line
            position graph is equivalent to a level and negative
            velocity graph. A steeper position graph means a greater
            constant velocity. If the position graph is level, the
            velocity graph is zero.   </p>
          <p>Going one step farther, a steadily changing velocity
            implies a constant acceleration. It also implies that the
            slope of the position graph is changing, so it will not be a
            straight line. It will be a parabola. Students will observe
            this if they let the cart roll up and down a ramp, or run it
            with the propeller. There are many situations in science
            where one quantity is the rate of change of another (e.g.
            acceleration and velocity, power and energy, heat quantity
            and heat flow, population and birth rate), and this is also
            what calculus is all about.   </p>
          <shared-image name="01_swDetail" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>Sophisticated electronics are used to sense the rotation of
            the SmartWheel and use that data to generate a graph on the
            computer. An invisible infrared beam is directed through the
            clear plastic disk that has regular black lines printed on
            it. A sensor detects when a black line blocks the beam. Each
            time the beam is blocked means the wheel is turned a bit.
            The computer simply counts how many times the beam is
            blocked. There are actually two beams and this allows the
            computer to figure out which way the wheel is turning. If
            the wheel is turning one direction, the computer adds 1 each
            time the beam is blocked, but if it turns the other
            direction, it subtracts 1. The computer program interprets
            this information either as position (how many black lines go
            by) or as velocity (how fast the black lines go by).  </p>

          <summary>The focus of this investigation is the study of the
            effect of forces on motion. Students will explore
            quantitative changes (e.g., velocity, force, acceleration,
            etc.) over time on a line graph that results from a mounted
            propeller on the air cart with or without an attached sled.
            By using a SmartWheel and Force probe connected to their
            handheld computer, the students will investigate resulting
            motions. By exploring a somewhat puzzling situation, the
            students are encouraged to explain their ideas through
            clarification, justification, and representation. </summary>

          <teacher-overview>Ask students to debate what effect forces
            have on motion. The simplest answer is that a force can
            speed up or slow down an object, but students are unlikely
            to know that right at the beginning. If they say this too
            quickly, perhaps they have memorized this rule without
            thought. Push them for examples and ask them to explain why
            a bike going fast on a level road requires force just to
            keep a steady velocity. Why does it take more force to
            maintain a greater velocity? The answer is that air
            resistance increases rapidly with velocity, so higher speeds
            need more force to balance it.<p>At the right moment, you
              need to point out that in science, the word
              &quot;force&quot; has a restricted meaning. We are not
              talking about usage such as &quot;forceful
              personality&quot; or &quot;a military force.&quot; Our use
              is restricted to pushes and pulls. In the same vein, we
              use &quot;motion&quot; only to refer to the way something
              moves from point to point. It is not about &quot;a motion
              to adjourn.&quot;  </p>

          <teacher-stage>Ask students to debate what effect forces have

              that the propeller provides a constant force and this
              force causes a constantly changing velocity. This appears
              as a slanted straight line on a velocity graph. On a
              position graph a constant force generates a parabola.</p>

              <answer>You would see two straight lines, one going up and
                the other going down at the same slant.</answer>
              <question>What do all your position graphs have in common? </question>
              <answer>They all have parts that are curved upward or
                downward. These are all parts of a parabola.</answer>

                about the velocity? </question>

            </teacher-questions>
          </teacher-stage>
          <teacher-wrap>The sled increases the friction on the cart and
            creates a force that opposes the force provided by the
            propeller, and the result is a straight-line velocity graph
            with a reduced slope. Have the students predict what happens
            to the slope of the velocity versus time graph as you add
            mass to the sled? [It slants less and appears more
            horizontal] </teacher-wrap>
        </teacher-discuss>
        <teacher-background>This investigation introduces force. A
          battery-operated propeller is used to generate a light,
          constant force and a new sensor is used to measure the forces.
          In many respects, this unit is central to the entire set of
          five force and motion units. The key point is that force
          causes a change in velocity. If you observe a velocity change,
          there must be some force acting. If velocity is constant, then
          no force is present. If there is more than one force on an
          object, it is the NET force that matters; two opposite forces
          can cancel out.  <p>If you tossed a ball straight up and let
            it fall, what would the velocity versus time graph look
            like? The result is very surprising. The velocity versus
            time graph is a downward-sloping straight line the whole
            time. It passes through the x-axis at the moment when the
            ball is at its maximum height. You can observe this by
            pushing a cart up a ramp, then letting it roll down again.
            The position versus time graph is a parabola, and the
            velocity versus time graph is a straight line with negative
            slope.  </p>
          <p>The sled adds back the friction we worked so hard to get
            rid of in the cart, but now instead of being hidden from
            view, it can be adjusted at will. The propeller pulls one
            way, and the sled pulls the other. This reduces the net
            force on the cart, and it will change velocity more slowly
            as weight is added to the sled.  </p>
          <p>Surprisingly, the kinetic friction provided by the sled is
            roughly constant regardless of velocity, just like the force
            provided by the propeller. This is demonstrated by the fact
            that when you give the cart a push and let the sled bring it
            to a stop, the velocity versus time graph is a straight
            line. Constant change in velocity implies constant force.
            This isn&apos;t completely true, however. Is it possible to
            identify a terminal velocity for a cart with a weighted
            sled? Yes, this is the point where the drag force just
            equals the driving force, and the velocity stops increasing.</p>
          <shared-image name="01_swDetail" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>The SmartWheel is also used in this investigation. Some
            sophisticated electronics are used to sense the rotation of
            the wheel and use that to generate a graph on the computer.
            An invisible infrared beam is directed through the clear
            plastic disk that has regular black lines printed on it. A
            sensor detects when a black line blocks the beam. Each time
            the beam is blocked means the wheel is turned a bit. The
            computer simply counts how many times the beam is blocked.
            There are actually two beams and this allows the computer to
            figure out which way the wheel is turning. If the wheel is
            turning one direction, the computer adds 1 each time the
            beam is blocked, but if it turns the other direction, it
            subtracts 1. The computer program interprets this
            information either as position (how many black lines go by)
            or as velocity (how fast the black lines go by).</p>

            resulting shape of a line graph. By using a stationary Force
            probe connected to their handheld computer, the students
            will investigate the collision of their cart as it impacts
            the Force probe. By engaging with relevant phenomena from
            their everyday life, the students are encouraged to question
            their surroundings.  </summary>

          <teacher-overview>This investigation looks at two collisions
            of a cart with a fixed object. One is a hard collision with
            the wall. Although it happens quickly, students can capture
            the time history of the force of the wall on the cart by
            mounting the force detector on the cart. A much more gentle
            collision is caused by rubber bands. Students might not see
            this as a collision without a discussion of what a collision
            is.  <p>The acrobat provides an informal way to OBSERVE
              forces and how quickly they change. A constant force will
              cause the acrobat to hang at an angle. If the force on the
              cart changes quickly, the acrobat will fly around. If the
              force changes slowly, the acrobat will rock gently.  </p>
          </teacher-overview>
          <teacher-stage>Collisions are more common than students may
            think. The air around us consists of molecules that are each
            colliding 100 million times per second. The air in a cube
            about one foot on a side has 50 million trillion trillion
            collisions per second. Every one of those collisions obeys
            the same laws that are explored in this investigation.
              <p>To stimulate interest in collisions, ask students:</p>
            <teacher-questions>
              <question>List different kinds of collisions-big and
                small, fast and slow.</question>
              <answer>Examples: two cars, baseball and bat, boat with
                its dock, asteroid and the earth, two galaxies, two
                electrons in a wire.</answer>
              <question>Do all collisions result in damage?</question>
              <answer>No</answer>
              <question>Do two colliding objects need to touch?</question>
              <answer>No. Imagine two carts with repelling magnets.</answer>
            </teacher-questions>
            <p>To stimulate reflection about collisions, ask:  </p>
            <teacher-questions>
              <question>What happens to the velocity in a collision?</question>
              <answer>It often drops to zero quickly.</answer>
              <question>Are there forces during a collision?</question>
              <answer>Yes. Each of the colliding objects pushes on the other.</answer>
              <question>What causes damage in a collision?</question>
              <answer>Large forces.</answer>
              <question>How are forces and velocity changes related in a collision?</question>
              <answer>The velocity of each object changes and because
                there is some force between the objects. Larger velocity
                changes are associated with larger forces.</answer>
              <question>What will happen to the acrobat in a collision?</question>
              <answer>It depends on how quickly the velocity changes. A
                hard collision causes a fast velocity change that will
                cause the acrobat to rock violently.</answer>
              <question>Is the acrobat like a passenger in a car?</question>
              <answer>Yes. When it rocks violently it is modeling a
                dangerous collision.</answer>
            </teacher-questions>
            <p>To focus student attention on the force detector, ask:</p>
            <teacher-questions>
              <question>Prove that there is a magnet in the arm.</question>
              <answer>Students can experiment with a paperclip or other
                iron object.</answer>
              <question>How do you know that there is a magnetic field
                detector in the probecard?</question>
              <answer>They can verify that the detector is sensitive to
                magnetic fields by bringing a magnet near the sensor and
                observing the resulting &quot;force&quot; graph on the
                computer. They can also rotate the Force probe and
                detect changes due to the Earth&apos;s magnetic field.</answer>
              <question>Note that there are two eye bolts on the beam.
                Which one is more sensitive? Which would we use to
                measure a big force?</question>
              <answer>When the eye bolt is near the end of the beam, a
                small force is required to bend the arm, making it most
                sensitive. It can measure the weight of a dime. At the
                other location, a big force is needed to bend the beam.
                You can weigh a student there.</answer>
            </teacher-questions>
            <p>It is important to bring students back to considering the
              forces and velocity changes in collisions. First, address
              some difficult points in the investigations:  </p>
            <teacher-questions>
              <question>Why is Trial III like a collision?</question>
              <answer>For all collisions, a force causes a change of
                velocity in a short time. The rubber bands cause this to
                happen, just over a longer time than usual, because of a
                much smaller force.</answer>
              <question>In a collision with the wall, is the force on
                the wall greater than the force on the cart? </question>
              <answer>No, they are the same. This is the point of Trial I.</answer>
              <question>In the collision with rubber bands, is the force
                on whatever is holding the rubber band smaller than the
                force of the rubber band on the cart?</question>
              <answer>No, they are the same.</answer>
            </teacher-questions>
            <p>Now encourage students to think about the forces and
              velocity changes in different collisions by asking:
              &quot;What are the relative sizes of the forces caused by
              the propeller, rubber band, and bumper?&quot; [The bumper
              caused a force that is many times that of the rubber band,
              and the propeller&apos;s force was much smaller. (You
              might calculate these ratios, but the calculations might
              distract students, too.)]  </p>
          </teacher-stage>
          <teacher-wrap>Cover some optional finer points by asking:<teacher-questions>
              <question>What is the difference between mass and weight?</question>
              <answer>Weight is the force of gravity on an object. We
                can use a force probe to measure weight, but not mass.</answer>
              <question>What is the relationship between mass and weight?</question>
              <answer>The weight of an object in newtons is 9.8 times
                its mass in kilograms, on earth.</answer>
              <question>Where would mass and weight have a different relationship?</question>
              <answer>On the moon, in space, anywhere gravity is
                different from its value on the surface of the earth.</answer>
              <question>Compare the forces on massive and light carts
                that each collide with a wall at the same speed.</question>
              <answer>A larger force is required to stop or turn around
                a more massive cart. This is why a heavier car causes
                more damage.</answer>
            </teacher-questions>
          </teacher-wrap>
        </teacher-discuss>
        <teacher-background>This investigation shows how we can learn a
          lot by looking closely. The probes allow students to slow down
          a very fast event-a collision-and look at what happened every
          few thousandths of a second. It&apos;s like having a
          microscope for time. What is happening is that forces due to
          contact change the velocity. The ideas students learned about
          the effect of force on carts can be applied to collisions. If
          the velocity changes quickly, there is a big force. This is
          what causes damage. If the collision is softer, the velocity
          changes more slowly, indicating that there is less force.
            <p>The Force probe works on the simple principle that a
            rigid beam will bend an amount that is proportional to the
            force exerted on it. Instead of trying to define
            &quot;force&quot;, you can simply say that it is what the
            force probe measures. In this case, the beam is aluminum, it
            can be either pushed or pulled, and it has stops so that it
            won&apos;t be bent beyond its elastic limit. There are two
            eye bolts at different distances along the beam. The one
            that is nearer the end gives a more sensitive reading,
            because it takes less force to move the beam a certain
            amount. The lighter range is + or - 20N, and the heavier
            range is + or - 200N.  </p>
          <shared-image name="01_forceProbe" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>The deflection of the beam is measured with a little chip
            called a Hall effect sensor, which measures magnetic field.
            A strong magnet is embedded in the end of the beam, and the
            Hall effect sensor is next to it. As the beam moves, the
            magnetic field changes and the sensor&apos;s output changes
            too.  </p>
          <shared-image name="02_forceProbeDet" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>If the sensor card is unscrewed from the Force probe, it
            can be used as a general-purpose magnetic field sensor. It
            can easily detect the Earth&apos;s magnetic field, which you
            will notice if you rotate it and expand the graph.  </p>

        <steps>
          <step>The Force probe can be used to measure the force of the
            Earth&apos;s gravity on masses. In other words, the Force
            probe can be used to measure the weight of masses. Connect
            the Force probe to your handheld computer. Refer to
            Technical Hints to see how to connect the cables.   </step>
          <step>Start the software. </step>
          <step> Hold the Force probe so that you can hang things from
            the smaller eye bolt at the end of the arm. Set the force
            probe to zero in this position. Refer to Technical Hints to

          <summary>The focus of this investigation is on equal and

            and the collisions of two moving carts. Students will
            explore quantitative changes (e.g., impact forces, impact
            times, resulting velocities, etc.) by analyzing the
            resulting shape of a line graph during collisions of carts
            of different masses. By engaging with relevant phenomena
            from their everyday life, the students are provided with a
            sense of connection between science and the world around
            them.  </summary>

        <teacher-discuss>
          <teacher-overview>This investigation continues the exploration
            of collisions. The last investigation involved single carts
            colliding with fixed objects; here two carts collide. This
            is much closer to the collisions between molecules in a gas
            or between two cars. Because two carts are needed, pairs of
            student groups will need to work together.  <p>This
              investigation provides yet another situation in which
              force is related to change in velocity. It may seem
              repetitive, but it is worth hammering home this
              relationship because it is central to the study of force
              and motion. The other important idea in this investigation
              is that the forces on the two colliding carts are the
              same. The force of cart A on B is exactly the same as the
              force of B on A, even if they have different masses.
              Students saw this idea in the previous investigation, but
              it is worth repeating in this new context. Most students
              think that the more massive cart will exert a larger force
              on the lighter cart, but this is wrong.  </p>
            <p>This idea is most dramatically shown in Trial I, where
              students with force probes play tug-of-war. No matter what
              they do - who pulls &quot;harder&quot;, who pulls and who
              stands still - the force probe graphs will be identical.
              Most people find this quite surprising, and it&apos;s
              worth discussing many examples: a car and a truck,
              standing on a table, a fly and a fly-swatter.  </p>
          </teacher-overview>
          <teacher-stage>A discussion on automobile collisions can
            provide context for this investigation. Focus on the role of
            devices that save people, including bumpers, seat belts, and
            airbags. The operation of each of these safety devices can
            be explained in terms of forces and velocity change. The key
            is realizing that you want to avoid large forces. Large
            forces are what maim and kill. After introducing this idea,
            ask to explain in terms of what they have learned about
            forces and velocities:  <teacher-questions>
              <question>Why are high speed accidents more dangerous than
                low speed ones?</question>
              <answer>All other things being equal, a high speed
                collision results in a larger change in velocity. This
                requires a bigger force that the wall, tree, or other
                car you collide with will provide.</answer>
              <question>Why do cars have bumpers?</question>
              <answer>A bumper is designed to increase the time of
                collision by slowly giving away. This reduces the rate
                of change of velocity, resulting in less force.</answer>
              <question>What good is a seatbelt?</question>
              <answer>The seatbelt stops you from hitting the dashboard
                or window. Because those are hard, collisions with them
                generate huge forces. When your head hits the
                windshield, its velocity changes very quickly and the
                resulting force is huge.</answer>
              <question>What good is an airbag?</question>
              <answer>When it inflates, it applies a force on you to
                slow you down quickly but much more gently than the
                windshield would. Spreading the force over a longer time
                means that the maximum force is smaller.</answer>

          <teacher-wrap>Because this investigation concludes the study
            of force and motion, lead a discussion that draws from all
            five investigations. One way to do this is to introduce
            Newton&apos;s Laws and ask for evidence from these
            experiments for each law:  <teacher-questions>
              <question>Newton&apos;s First Law says that when no force
                acts on an object it continues at a fixed velocity. What
                evidence have we seen for this?</question>
              <answer>The rolling cart that continues at almost a
                constant speed on a level surface. Of course it does
                slow down a bit, the result of some frictional force.</answer>
              <question>Is a cart at rest evidence for the First Law?</question>
              <answer>Yes. Zero velocity is a constant velocity, too. If
                there is no force on a cart at rest, it stays at rest.</answer>
              <question>Newton&apos;s Second Law says that force causes
                a change of velocity. What evidence have we seen for this?</question>
              <answer>The following forces have all caused velocity
                changes that we have measured: the force of gravity on
                the ramp, the force of the propeller, the force of
                friction from the sled, the force of the wall in
                Collision I, the force of the rubber bands, and the
                force of the other cart in Collision II.</answer>
              <question>Have we ever observed a force that did not cause
                a velocity change?</question>
              <answer>Yes, if you count only one force that was balanced
                by another. For instance, if you hold the cart while the
                propeller is going, or oppose the propeller&apos;s force
                with a sail, there are two opposite forces. The net
                force is zero, so there is no change in velocity and
                Newton&apos;s Second Law is still true.</answer>
              <question>Newton&apos;s Third Law says that the force of A
                on B is equal and opposite to the force of B on A. What
                evidence have we seen for this?</question>
              <answer>In Collision II, two force probes push or pull on
                each other, and their force graphs are the same.</answer>
              <question>Can you think of any exception to the Third Law?
                What about a SUV colliding with a VW bug or a hammer
                crushing an egg?</question>
              <answer>There are no exceptions.</answer>

        <teacher-background>
          <p>The Force probe works on the simple principle that a rigid
            beam will bend an amount that is proportional to the force
            exerted on it. Instead of trying to define
            &quot;force&quot;, you can simply say that it is what the
            force probe measures. In this case, the beam is aluminum, it
            can be either pushed or pulled, and it has stops so that it
            won&apos;t be bent beyond its elastic limit. There are two
            eye bolts at different distances along the beam. The one
            that is nearer the end gives a more sensitive reading,
            because it takes less force to move the beam a certain
            amount. The lighter range is +/- 20N, and the heavier range
            is +/- 200N.  </p>
          <shared-image name="01_forceProbe" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>The deflection of the beam is measured with a little chip
            called a Hall effect sensor, which measures magnetic field.
            A strong magnet is embedded in the end of the beam, and the
            Hall effect sensor is next to it. As the beamm moves, the
            magnetic field changes and the sensor changes its output.  </p>
          <shared-image name="02_forceProbeDet" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>If the sensor is unscrewed from the Force probe, it can be
            used as a general-purpose magnetic field sensor. It can
            easily detect the Earth&apos;s magnetic field, which you
            will notice if you rotate it and expand the graph. This also
            means, however, that the Force probe should be recalibrated
            to zero whenever its position or orientation is changed.  </p>
          <shared-image name="01_swDetail" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>The SmartWheel is also used in this investigation. Some
            sophisticated electronics are used to sense the rotation of
            the wheel and use that to generate a graph on the computer.
            An invisible infrared beam is directed through the clear
            plastic disk that has regular black lines printed on it. A
            sensor detects when a black line blocks the beam. Each time
            the beam is blocked means the wheel is turned a bit. The
            computer simply counts how many times the beam is blocked.
            There are actually two beams and this allows the computer to
            figure out which way the wheel is turning. If the wheel is
            turning one direction, the computer adds 1 each time the
            beam is blocked, but if it turns the other direction, it
            subtracts 1. The computer program interprets this
            information either as position (how many black lines go by)
            or as velocity (how fast the black lines go by).  </p>

        <teacher-discuss>
          <teacher-overview>The point of this investigation is to
            introduce heat energy. It is natural for your students to
            confuse heat and temperature. Help them by insisting that
            they carefully distinguish between temperature and heat. It
            is also helpful to consistently use the term &quot;heat
            energy&quot; instead of simply &quot;heat&quot;. The
            Temperature probe can help make this distinction. We can
            define temperature as what is measured by the Temperature
            probe. This provides a clean, simple operational definition
            of temperature.   <p>Unfortunately, we have no comparable
              way of measuring heat energy directly. All we can do is
              measure the effect of heat energy flowing into or out of
              an object. We can define heat energy flowing into the heat
              cell as whatever causes it to warm up. We can measure how
              much heat energy flows into the heat cell by measuring how
              much it warms up. For every degree the heat cell warms,
              ten joules of heat energy must have flowed into it.
              Conversely, if the heat cell cools by a degree, ten joules
              of heat energy must have flowed out of it. Whenever there
              is a change in the temperature of the heat cell, we can
              infer that heat energy flowed in or out by observing the
              temperature rise or fall. </p>
            <p>This still doesn&apos;t tell us the total amount of heat
              energy in an object. All this definition does is tell how
              much heat energy has been added or subtracted. We cannot
              do better. Heat energy is a relative thing. I can choose
              to say that there is no heat energy in the heat cell when
              it is at 0.0 C. Then if it is at 25 C, I would say it
              contained 250 joules of heat energy because it needed 250
              joules of heat energy to get it that warm. But someone
              else might define zero heat energy at 20 C, so they would
              say that it contained only 50 Joules of heat energy at 25
              C. </p>
            <p>Because heat energy cannot be measured, it seems
              mysterious. It would be wonderful to have some sort of
              thin plastic sensor we could wrap around an object that
              would tell exactly how much heat energy the object
              contained. Unfortunately, this sensor is impossible to
              make. Students will have to make do with measuring the
              change in temperature of the heat cell and using that to
              infer changes in heat energy of an object.   </p>
            <p>Heat energy flows from hot to cold. In the process, the
              hot object cools and the cold object warms. Heat energy
              continues to flow until both are at the same temperature.
              When this happens, no further heat energy flows and the
              temperature stays constant. This is why everything in a
              room tends to reach the same temperature: &quot;room
              temperature&quot;.   </p>
          </teacher-overview>
          <teacher-stage>Start by focusing student attention on the
            difference between heat energy and temperature. Define heat
            as a form of energy and tell students that they must always
            say &quot;heat energy&quot; to help remember this. Also, ban
            the term &quot;heat up,&quot; which means &quot;increase the
            temperature&quot;. Probe students to find out what they
            already know about heat energy. Ask:   <teacher-questions>
              <question>If heat energy is added to something, what
                happens to its temperature?</question>
              <answer>It usually gets warmer.</answer>
              <question>If I put a cold rock into a cup of hot water,
                why does the rock get hotter?</question>
              <answer>Heat energy flows into it.</answer>
              <question>If I put the same cold rock into a bathtub of
                hot water, the same temperature as the water in the cup
                in the last question, does the rock get hotter than
                before? Why?</question>
              <answer>The bathtub starts with more heat energy than the
                cup. Removing heat energy from the big bathtub to warm
                the rock only cools it slightly because it starts with
                so much.</answer>
              <question>Use heat energy flow to explain why blowing on a
                cup of hot chocolate cools it.</question>
              <answer>Heat energy flows quickly from the hot water to
                the cool air above it. Normally this warms the air to
                the water temperature and heat energy flow stops. When
                you blow away that warmed air and replace it with colder
                air, more heat energy can flow out of the hot chocolate.
                As the hot chocolate looses heat energy this way, it cools.</answer>
              <question>If I place an unplugged hot iron on a cloth
                ironing board, why does the cloth burn</question>
              <answer>Heat energy from the iron heats the cloth. Because
                the iron contains a lot of heat energy, it gets the
                cloth quite hot.</answer>
              <question>Use heat energy and temperature to explain what
                is happening when a teapot sitting on a hot stove is boiling.</question>
              <answer>Heat energy is flowing from the hot stove into the
                water, but the water isn&apos;t getting hotter. Instead
                the heat energy goes into converting the liquid water
                into steam, a gas. This is one case in which the
                addition of heat energy does not result in a temperature rise.</answer>
            </teacher-questions>
            <p>As soon as feasible, draw attention to the temperature
              probe. It responds very quickly and is so small that it
              barely changes the temperature of anything it is
              measuring. Have students get used to it by measuring
              temperatures around the room. Hold the sensor near their
              nose and observe their breathing by recording temperature
              variations.   </p>
          </teacher-stage>
          <teacher-wrap>After the trials, return again to the
            distinction between heat energy and temperature. This may
            seem like overkill, but research shows that many middle
            school students fail to make this distinction, even when
            taught very well. Encourage students to reflect on their
            explorations. Ask:   <teacher-questions>
              <question>If you dropped a hot heat cell into cold water
                and its temperature dropped by 12 C, what happened to
                its heat energy?</question>
              <answer>A total of 120 joules of heat energy left the heat
                cell and warmed the water.</answer>
              <question>Use heat energy ideas to explain why an
                insulator can keep something hot.</question>
              <answer>An insulator slows down the flow of heat energy.
                The slower heat energy escapes a hot object, it longer
                it will stay hot.</answer>
              <question>Can an insulator that is good at keeping
                something hot also keep it cold?</question>
              <answer>Yes. Keeping something cold requires blocking heat
                energy flow in. An insulator that blocks heat energy
                flow out works just as well at blocking heat energy flow in.</answer>

        <teacher-background>When two equal volumes of water at different
          temperatures are mixed, the temperature is halfway between the
          two because the quantity of heat energy that flows between
          them cools one the same amount as it heats the other. Water
          also mixes quite quickly.  <p>A solid, such as a ball of clay
            behaves differently. It doesn&apos;t mix physically with the
            surrounding water. The surface of the clay quickly reaches
            the water temperature. Then it takes some time for the heat
            of the clay to flow to the surrounding water (or the other
            way round, depending on which, is warmer). It may take
            several minutes for the water and clay to reach the same
            temperature. This new temperature will be somewhere between
            the two starting temperatures, but it depends on the
            quantity of each and their relative heat capacities or, in
            other words, how much heat energy each material gives up
            when it changes one degree Celsius. Water has a very high
            heat capacity compared to most common materials, including
            clay. So if equal weights of water and clay at different
            temperatures are mixed, the resulting temperature will be
            closer to the initial water temperature than that of the
            clay.  </p>
          <p>This brings up an important distinction between heat flow
            in fluids, such as water and air, and heat flow in solids.
            In fluids, the flow is often done by mixing - hot or cold
            substances traveling from one place to another. This is also
            called convection. It is usually driven by the fact that hot
            fluids are generally less dense and more buoyant than cold
            fluids, so they rise and circulate. Heating water on a
            stove, or hot air rising from the land on a sunny day, are
            good examples of conduction.  </p>
          <p>By contrast, the molecules in solids stay put. They can
            wiggle, but they cannot travel from one place to another. So
            energetic molecules transmit the heat energy in solids. They
            bump into their less energetic neighbors and pass the energy
            along. Electrons moving around also play a role. This is
            called heat conduction. Metals generally conduct extremely
            well. Materials like plastic foam, that trap air, are not as
            good conductors. Other materials, called insulators, are
            materials that slow down the flow of heat energy. Suppose
            the clay ball is hotter than room temperature. A temperature
            graph resulting from a Temperature probe in the center of
            the clay ball will drop quickly at first, then more slowly
            as it comes closer to room temperature. This is evidence
            that the rate of heat flow decreases as the difference
            between the two temperatures decrease. This smooth curve,
            that becomes less steep as it approaches the final
            temperature, is called a cooling curve. </p>

          <p>The Fast Response Temperature Probe uses a thermocouple to
            measure temperature. A thermocouple a made from two special
            wires, each of a different metal, with their ends twisted
            together or welded. When the temperature of that joint is
            different from the temperature of the other ends of the
            wires, a slight but highly predictable voltage is created.
            It comes from the way the two metals interact. Thermocouples
            are useful because they can work at very high temperatures.
            The CC Temperature probe can be put in a candle flame
            without damage.  <shared-image name="05_tempProbe" screenshot="false"/>
          </p>
          <p>The only sensitive part is the tip where two special bare
            wires are twisted together. The wires produce a voltage
            depending on the temperature, and the program converts this
            to degrees (C or F). The response is very fast, because the
            two wires are small and easily heated or cooled by whatever
            they touch.</p>

        <teacher-discuss>
          <teacher-overview>This investigation introduces two new kinds
            of energy - - both mechanical. Kinetic energy (KE) is energy
            of motion. An object needs to be moving to have kinetic
            energy. Potential energy (PE) depends on position or where
            an object is. An object gains potential energy by moving
            against a force. If the force is gravity, you gain potential
            energy by being raised. If the force is a rubber band, you
            gain potential energy by pulling against the rubber band. As
            an object moves, it can trade potential energy for kinetic
            or the reverse. For instance, a cart that is picking up
            speed while rolling down a ramp is loosing potential energy
            and gaining kinetic energy. A girl on a swing has potential
            energy at the ends of the swing, when the velocity (and
            kinetic energy) drops to zero, At the bottom of the swing,
            the girl is moving fastest, so the kinetic energy is high.
            Meanwhile the swing is at its lowest point, so its potential
            energy is lowest.  <p>Even though energy can change from
              potential to kinetic, the amazing thing is that the total
              energy stays constant. If there is no friction, the sum of
              potential and kinetic energy doesn&apos;t change. The
              demonstration of this requires a bit of calculation, so we
              put it in the Further Investigations section. If at all
              possible, we highly recommend doing these calculations.
              The point is that students pick some different instants
              during the cart&apos;s motion. For each time, they
              calculate PE and KE. At each instant PE and KE are
              different, but their sum is always the same, within
              experimental error. This investigation and the previous
              one appear unrelated, but they are linked because KE and
              PE can be transformed into heat energy. To limit the
              number of concepts introduced at one time, we have put off
              experiments on this transformation until later
              investigations. If students ask how the heat energy of
              last investigation relates to PE and KE, ask them:  </p>
            <teacher-questions>
              <question>What happens to PE and KE when you ride a bike
                down a steep hill but use your breaks to keep a constant speed?</question>
              <answer>Because the speed is constant, KE is constant.
                Going downhill means PE is decreasing. Where is the
                energy going? Into the brakes. Friction creates thermal
                energy which cause the brakes to get hotter.</answer>
              <question>Water going over Niagara Falls loses lots of PE.
                Where does this energy go?</question>
              <answer>At first, it goes into speeding up the falling
                water, giving it KE. But at the bottom of the falls, the
                water crashes into rocks and slows down, losing its KE.
                Friction in the water converts the KE into heat energy
                and the water gets slightly warmer. Because water is
                hard to warm up, it gets only a fraction of a degree hotter.</answer>
              <question>A space shuttle has to slow down and descend to
                land. What happens to its KE and PE?</question>
              <answer>For the shuttle to descend, it must lose PE. If
                the shuttle simply headed down, it would pick up speed,
                converting PE to KE. But it has to slow down to land, so
                it must lose KE, too. It gets rid of this energy by
                generating friction with the air. Air friction is
                increased by putting down flaps and the landing gear.
                All this friction generates heat energy that warms up
                the skin of the shuttle and the air, slightly. The
                shuttle is covered with ceramic blocks that get very hot
                on the outside but insulate the inside.</answer>

              <question>Does the shape of the hill matter?</question>

          <teacher-wrap>To demonstrate the generality of the ideas in
            this investigation, you might have students think about
            their application to another context where there is not too
            much friction, such as riding a roller coaster or
            automobile, shooting an arrow, dropping a pumpkin, or
            traveling to the moon or Mars. Assign one context to each
            group and ask each to answer the following:
              <p>&quot;Describe and draw a trip (or motion) that
              doesn&apos;t involve a motor or other power source. How
              does PE and KE change during the trip.&quot;  </p>
            <p>&quot;If there were no friction, how would the trip be changed?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;How does the object get the PE it started
              with?&quot;  </p>
            <p>&quot;Describe the forces needed to give the object its
              starting PE.&quot;</p>
          </teacher-wrap>
        </teacher-discuss>
        <teacher-background>The classic example of the smooth exchange
          of PE and KE is a pendulum. Let&apos;s say the relative
          gravitational PE is zero when the object is just hanging
          straight down. At the top of its swing, the object isn&apos;t
          moving, so it has no KE. But it does have PE because it&apos;s
          higher than the straight-down position. At the bottom of the
          swing, the object is moving at its fastest, so it has the most
          KE but no PE. If you calculated the sum of PE and KE at every
          instant, it would be constant.  <p>The principle that energy
            can neither be created nor destroyed is one of the most
            important in physics. It has been widely tested and found to
            be true for all forms of energy at all different scales. It
            may not appear to be true in everyday life. A falling rock
            hits the earth and stops. Where did the energy go? A
            physicist would assert that the rock&apos;s kinetic energy
            changed entirely into heat energy - a warmed-up rock and
            piece of earth. When energy seems to &quot;disappear&quot;,
            it usually is lost as heat energy into the environment.</p>
          <p>The SmartWheel is also used in this investigation. Some
            sophisticated electronics are used to sense the rotation of
            the wheel and use that to generate a graph on the computer.
            An invisible infrared beam is directed through the clear
            plastic disk that has regular black lines printed on it. A
            sensor detects when a black line blocks the beam. Each time
            the beam is blocked means the wheel is turned a bit. The
            computer simply counts how many times the beam is blocked.
            There are actually two beams and this allows the computer to
            figure out which way the wheel is turning. If the wheel is
            turning one direction, the computer adds 1 each time the
            beam is blocked, but if it turns the other direction, it
            subtracts 1. The computer program interprets this
            information either as position (how many black lines go by)
            or as velocity (how fast the black lines go by).  </p>

          <teacher-overview>This investigation introduces electricity
            and the energy associated with it. This is hard for kids,
            because you cannot see electricity directly and we cannot
            measure its energy directly. This unit uses a hand crank to
            generate electricity, because students can feel the energy
            they need to exert to generate electricity. This provides an
            experiential basis for understanding electricity and
            electrical energy.   <p>Electrical energy can be converted
              into heat energy easily and with 100% efficiency. This
              provides a way to relate this unit to the one on heat
              flow. This trick of converting electrical to heat energy
              is done with a resistor mounted in the heat cell. Making
              this connection between the two forms of energy should
              help dispel some of the mystery surrounding electrical
              energy.   </p>
            <p>This unit also introduces a way of measuring electrical
              energy flow directly with the voltage and current probe.
              Although it is a black box, by using the probe to measure
              energy created by hand turning the generator, students get
              a good idea of what it is measuring. </p>
            <p>Two properties are used with electricity that are easily
              confused: current and voltage. Current is the amount of
              electricity flowing, a bit like the current in a stream.
              Current can be though of as the total number of electrons
              flowing per second through a wire or through a substance.
              You can imagine measuring current by setting up a
              tollbooth in a wire and simply counting how many electrons
              went through each second.   </p>
            <p>Current is measured in amperes (A). To measure the
              current in a wire, you have to set up a tollbooth by
              breaking the wire and forcing the current to go through
              your current probe. This makes measuring current a pain;
              you have to disrupt the circuit to insert the current
              probe. </p>
            <p>Voltage is like potential energy; in fact it is called
              electrical potential. The voltage between points A and B
              is a measure of the energy each electron could release if
              it went from A to B. It makes no sense to state the
              voltage at A; voltage at one place is always measured
              relative to some other place, just like PE. For instance,
              if you say that you have a 9 volt battery, you mean that
              the energy released per electron that flows from one
              terminal to the other of this battery is 9 volts.   </p>
            <p>Voltage difference is measured in volts (V). The probe
              requires two leads because voltage is always the potential
              for energy release between two points. Voltage can be
              measured just by touching the two leads to two places.   </p>
            <p>Electrical energy requires both current and voltage. If
              you have current flowing but no voltage difference, then
              no energy is being transmitted. This actually happens in
              superconductors.  Huge currents can flow with no voltage
              drop. If there is a voltage drop but no current, then no
              energy is moving. A disconnected battery is a common
              example of this.   </p>
            <p>The rate at which energy moves is called power.
              Electrical power (P) is simply the product of current (I)
              and voltage difference (V):   </p>
            <equation>P = IV</equation>
            <p>This formula captures the idea that if there is no
              current (I=0) or no voltage difference (V=0), then no
              energy is moving. Power measures the flow of energy. This
              unit uses a probe for power. The probe actually measures
              both current and voltage and the computer multiplies these
              to get power. Four connections are needed: two for the
              current and two for the voltage.   </p>
            <p>Power is not exactly energy, it is the rate of energy
              flow. In the unit, students can use a probe to measure the
              electrical power and the heating it causes. Electrical
              power causes the heat cell to warm. The more power that is
              added, the faster it will warm. Students will see this as
              the slope of the temperature graph for the heat cell. The
              harder they crank, the more power will be generated and
              the steeper the temperature will rise.   </p>
            <p>If students crank at a constant speed, the power, or rate
              of energy transfer, is constant. The total electrical
              energy they generate is equal to the power times the time
              they crank. They can also compute the added thermal energy
              by multiplying the heat cell&apos;s temperature rise by
              ten. Is the electrical energy generated the same as the
              thermal energy delivered to the heat cell? It should be,
              within experimental error.   </p>

                generator, which is like a motor in reverse. The energy

                Only a tiny bit of light energy suffices.</answer>
            </teacher-questions>
          </teacher-wrap>
        </teacher-discuss>
        <teacher-background>To understand how electricity heats things,
          one needs to how electricity flows through materials. All
          common materials are made up of atoms. Each atom has equal
          numbers of positively charged protons, which are tightly bound
          together in a nucleus, and negatively charged electrons which
          surround the nucleus in a sort of cloud. Since the number of
          protons is equal to the number of electrons in a neutral atom,
          their charges cancel each other and the net charge of the atom
          is zero. The electrons are strongly attracted to the protons
          in the nucleus and can not stray far from it.  <p>Electrical
            current is the flow of charges, usually the negatively
            charge electrons, through a material. When a voltage
            difference is applied, such as when a battery is attached to
            two ends of a wire, an electrical force is exerted on every
            electron. The electrons drift away from the negative pole
            and toward the positive pole. Individual electrons may not
            move very much, but the net effect is an electrical current.  </p>
          <p>In insulating materials that do not conduct electricity,
            there are almost no charges that are free to move. Metals
            such as copper, aluminum, and iron can conduct because some
            of the electrons are free to move around. Semi-conductors,
            special materials used for electronic circuits, are in
            between the two extremes. When a voltage difference is
            applied to a wire, the electrons are accelerated, and they
            hit the atoms in the metal. It&apos;s like someone trying to
            run through a crowd and knocking people this way and that.
            This makes the atoms vibrate or wiggle around, which results
            in heat energy in the material. As a result, the temperature
            of the material rises. It&apos;s like friction, except
            instead of the atoms being agitated by two surfaces rubbing
            together, they are agitated by the motion of the electrons.  </p>
          <p>Electrical resistors are designed to &quot;resist&quot; the
            flow of electrical current. The greater the resistance, the
            harder it is for current to flow freely. The energy that it
            takes to make the current flow is all converted into heat
            energy. Whenever electricity flows through normal materials,
            some of the energy is lost as heat. Sometimes this is
            desirable, as with electrical heating elements. Sometimes it
            is a waste, as with power lines.  </p>
          <p>The heat cell consists of a 10 ohm resistor in the center
            of a block of aluminum. Current flowing through the resistor
            heats it up, and the heat spreads throughout the whole
            aluminum block. Because aluminum conducts heat extremely
            well, the resistor and the aluminum stay at almost the same
            temperature. The little foam box reduces heat loss to the
            surroundings.  </p>
          <p>The electrical energy flowing into the heat cell and being
            converted to heat can be measured by hooking it to the
            Voltage/Current probe and plotting energy or power. It can
            also be measured by monitoring the change in temperature of
            the heat cell with the Temperature probe. Since changes in
            temperature are proportional to changes in heat energy of
            the heat cell, the temperature graph looks like a graph of
            the heat energy.  </p>
          <p>The amount of aluminum is such that it takes exactly 10
            joules of energy to raise the temperature of the heat cell 1
            degree Celsius. The slope of this graph is the rate of
            energy transfer, or power.  </p>
          <p>If the heat cell, without insulation, is connected to the
            Genecon that is cranked for 30s. The graph would look like
            this: </p>
          <shared-image name="31_th_heatcell" screenshot="true"/>
          <p>If the cranking rate is constant, the heating portion of
            the graph is a straight line with a positive slope. The
            power input (the slope of the line) is constant. </p>
          <p>In this example, the temperature change is about (29.5
            degrees C - 22 degrees C) = 7.5 degrees C, so the energy
            transfer is 75 joules. This takes about 30s, so the energy
            gain per second would be 75 joules/30s or 2.5joules/s or 2.5
            watts, which is the power the Genecon is producing. Once the
            Genecon is no longer cranked, the heat cell loses heat to
            the environment and slowly cools down. The slope is
            negative, which means the power input is negative and energy
            is being lost. In this example, the rate of loss is about
            1.5 degrees C/50s or 15 joules/50s or 0.3 joules/s or 0.3
            watts.   </p>
          <p>If the heat cell is connected to a battery, a similar graph
            will be obtained. Inside a battery, chemical reactions push
            electrons toward the negative pole and away from the
            positive pole. When a wire is connected across the poles of
            the battery, the electrons flow through the wire and make a current.</p>
          <p>These measurements present a good chance to explore the
            difference between power and energy. Energy, whatever form
            it takes, is constant in amount. It cannot be created or
            destroyed. It is measured in joules (J). Power is the rate
            of energy gained in a given amount of time. It is measured
            in joules per second (J/s), which is the same as watts (W).  </p>
          <p>There are many situations where amount and rate are used.
            Here are just a few:  </p>
          <table>
            <th>
              <td>Amount</td>
              <td>Rate</td>
            </th>
            <tr>
              <td>How much money: [dollars]</td>
              <td>Rate of earning money: [dollars/hour of income]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Distance traveled: [meters]</td>
              <td>Rate of traveling: [meters/second or speed]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>How much energy: [joules]</td>
              <td>Rate of gaining energy: [watts (J/s) or power]</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>In all of these cases to display the rate of change, the
            amount is graphed against time and results with the slope of
            that graph being the rate. If the rate is plotted against
            time, the area under the graph will be the amount that is
            accumulated.  </p>
          <p>The mini light shows that electrical energy can also be
            turned into light energy. The process is indirect, however.
            Light is a byproduct of heating the little wire in the bulb
            to a white-hot temperature. The wire radiates light and
            other invisible radiation in all directions. The clear tape
            lets most but not all of it through, but the aluminum foil
            blocks the light from radiating. Therefore the Temperature
            probe heats faster when the light is surrounded by foil. The
            energy is transformed from electrical to heat to light and
            back to heat again.  </p>
          <p>The Fast Response Temperature Probe uses a thermocouple to
            measure temperature. A thermocouple a made from two special
            wires, each of a different metal, with their ends twisted
            together or welded. When the temperature of that joint is
            different from the temperature of the other ends of the
            wires, a slight but highly predictable voltage is created.
            It comes from the way the two metals interact. Thermocouples
            are useful because they can work at very high temperatures.
            The CC Temperature probe can be put in a candle flame
            without damage.  </p>
          <shared-image name="05_tempProbe" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>The only sensitive part is the tip where two special bare
            wires are twisted together. The wires produce a voltage
            depending on the temperature, and the CCProbe software
            converts this to degrees (C or F). The response is very
            fast, because the two wires are small and easily heated or
            cooled by whatever they touch.  </p>
          <shared-image name="07_VIProbe" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>The Voltage/Current Probe measures either voltage or
            current. It can also measure both at the same time. The
            CCProbe software can use these readings to calculate and
            display power (watts) and energy (joules).   </p>
          <p>Voltage is like potential energy, The voltage between
            points A and B is a measure of the energy each electron
            could release as it moves from point A to point B in a wire.
            Voltage at one place is always measured relative to some
            other place. Therefore the probe requires two leads, and the
            voltage can be measured just by touching the two leads to
            two places. Voltage difference is measured in volts (V). The
            red clip lead goes to the greater, or positive (+) location,
            and the black clip lead goes to the smaller, or negative (-)
            location. To measure voltage across a heat cell , the clips
            are placed on the two ends of the heat cell as shown.  </p>
          <shared-image name="01_vi" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>Current is the amount of electricity flowing, a bit like
            the current in a stream. Current can be pictured as the
            total number of electrons flowing per second through a wire
            or other substance. You can imagine measuring current by
            setting up a tollbooth in a wire and simply counting how
            many electrons went by each second. Current is measured in
            amperes (A).</p>
          <p>To measure the current in a wire, you have to set up a
            tollbooth by breaking the wire and forcing the current to go
            through your current probe. The convention is that current
            is positive when it flows from a positive to a negative
            voltage, that is, from red to black. For the current through
            the probe to be positive, it should flow into the yellow
            clip lead and out of the green clip lead. Here is how to
            measure current going through a heat cell attached to a
            battery. Note: positioning of the probe is different while
            measuring current then it when measuring voltage.  </p>
          <shared-image name="02_vi" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>Electrical power, the rate of using energy, is the voltage
            difference times current. It can be pictured as the number
            of electrons flowing per second, multiplied by the energy
            each one loses (P=IV). Power is measured in watts (W).   </p>
          <p>To measure the power going into a heat cell from a battery,
            you must measure both voltage and current. The CCProbeware
            will calculate and display the power from these
            measurements.  </p>
          <shared-image name="03_vi" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>Electrical energy is the power accumulated over time. It
            can be pictured as the total number of electrons that flow,
            multiplied by the energy that each one gains (or loses).
            Energy is measured in joules (J). To measure the energy
            transferred into a heat cell from a battery, you must
            measure both voltage and current (see diagram above). The
            CCProbeware will calculate and display the energy from these
            measurements.  </p>
          <p>Depending on your needs, the Voltage/Current probe can be a
            volt meter, an ammeter, a power meter, or a joule meter!  </p>

          <query-description>When electricity flows through a wire, some
            of its energy goes into heating up the wire. Sometimes this
            is a problem. When electricity travels from a power station
            to the city, heat energy is wasted. But once the electricity
            arrives at your house for the purpose of heating a stove or

        <steps>
          <step>Connect the VoltageCurrent probe to your handheld
            computer. Refer to Technical Hints to see how to set up the
            VoltageCurrent probe.   </step>
          <step>Locate the parts for your small &quot; heat cell&quot;
            which consists of a resistor inside a block of aluminum.
            When you put electrical current through the resistor, it
            converts the electrical energy into heat and heats up the
            block of aluminum. The heat cell is placed in insulation to
            prevent heat loss to the environment.  <ext-image name="02_he"/>
          </step>
          <step>Remove the heat cell from its insulation. Attach the two
            leads of the Genecon to wires extending from the heat cell.
            Also connect the voltage leads and the current leads of
            VoltageCurrent probe to the heat cell. Follow the diagram
            carefully. Don &apos;t put the heat cell in the insulation
            yet.  <ext-image name="03_he"/>

        <teacher-discuss>
          <teacher-overview>The importance of energy is that it can be
            transformed from one form to another. This investigation
            demonstrates several common energy transformations. Of
            course, students have already seen some energy
            transformations in earlier investigations, so this
            investigation is actually designed to increase the range of
            transformations with which students are familiar.  <p>This
              investigation introduces the idea that energy can be found
              in many places.  In light, a capacitor, motion, heat, and
              sugar. One of the questions this raises is what defines
              energy. The easiest way to know if something has energy is
              to find a way to transform it into heat energy. If you can
              heat up the heat cell, then you had energy. In other
              words, energy is the ability to heat. This is a good
              definition, because all forms of energy can be transformed
              into heat energy. That&apos;s why transformations are
              important and why we explored heat energy first.</p>
            <p>There is another advantage in being able to convert any
              form of energy into heat energy: it is always 100%
              efficient. For instance, when you use electricity to heat
              the heat cell, all the electrical energy is transformed
              into heat. In the experiment that uses light to heat the
              heat cell, all the energy in the absorbed light is
              converted into heat.  </p>
            <p>Students may have heard that &quot;Energy is the ability
              to do work.&quot; This is correct in most situations, but
              it is useless unless you have a clear understanding of the
              technical meaning of work. Since students will not
              understand this, it would be best to avoid this
              formulation of energy. In case it comes up, you should
              know that &quot;work&quot; means force times the distance
              over which the force is applied.  </p>
            <p>The first trial in this investigation introduces an
              interesting new device, called a capacitor. A capacitor
              stores charge, so it provides a way of storing electrical
              energy. This is a lot like a rechargeable battery. The
              capacitor used has the capacity of one farad, which is
              huge. This is a million to a billion times the capacity of
              most capacitors found in electrical circuits.  </p>
            <p>It really is not important to describe how a capacitor
              works. Treat it as a &quot;black box&quot; in which
              electrical charge can be stored. The first activity gives
              students a &quot;feel&quot; for this. They can experience
              how it becomes more and more difficult to crank
              electricity into the capacitor as it fills up. They also
              see that a charged capacitor can turn the generator. This
              means that the energy they cranked into the capacitor can
              be converted into mechanical energy. They can also use the
              voltage and current probes to measure the flows of
              electrical energy in and out of the capacitor.  </p>
            <p>Your capacitor is big but fragile. It can be ruined two
              ways.  </p>
            <ul>
              <li>It will die if you put too much charge in it. Never
                put more than 5 volts across it.</li>
              <li>It will also die if you connect it backwards. Always
                connect positive voltage to the plus (+) terminal. This
                terminal is clearly marked on the capacitor.  </li>
            </ul>
          </teacher-overview>
          <teacher-stage>Start this investigation by challenging
            students to illustrate as many different energy
            transformations as possible. Ask them to show each energy
            form as a labeled circle. The label in the circle should be
            a form of energy, not an example. This means that
            &quot;kinetic energy&quot; is allowed, but not &quot;moving
            bicycle&quot; which is an example of kinetic energy.
              <p>Connect the circles with arrows. Label the arrows with
              one device that causes the transformation. Students end up
              with a mesh of arrows and circles that looks like a
              concept map.  </p>
            <p>Here is an example:</p>
            <shared-image name="29_th_resistorflow" screenshot="true"/>
            <p>Encourage debate among the students about these diagrams
              but avoid calling them right or wrong. Instead, ask
              students to save these for review at the end of the
              investigation.  </p>
            <p>Since few students will have ever seen a capacitor,
              introduce it before beginning the trials. Tell them that
              it stores electrical energy. Ask:  </p>
            <teacher-questions>
              <question>How would you know whether the capacitor
                contained electrical energy?</question>
              <answer>Its energy could be converted to another form.</answer>
              <question>What do you think you could do with a capacitor?</question>
              <answer>Heat up the heat cell. Run the propeller. Run your
                radio. </answer>
            </teacher-questions>
            <p>Warn student that the capacitor can be ruined if it are overloaded.</p>
          </teacher-stage>
          <teacher-wrap>After the trials, ask students working in groups
            to review the energy transformation drawings they made at
            the beginning of the investigation. Ask them to look for
            errors and additions. As these are presented to the class,
            have one student make a master diagram on the board.<p>As
              students present their ideas about energy transformations
              you may note some mistakes or statements that you are not
              sure of. Instead of trying to point out errors, ask for
              evidence or examples for every transformation. Ask what
              experiments in the investigation support each
              transformation.  </p>
            <p>The following are the most important transformations from
              this and previous investigations together with an example
              of each.  </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Potential energy --&gt; kinetic energy. [Bike speeding
                up as it goes down a hill.]  </li>
              <li>Kinetic energy --&gt; potential energy. [A bike
                coasting up a hill and slowing down.]</li>
              <li>Kinetic energy --&gt; heat energy. [Using the breaks
                on a bike to slow you down.]  </li>
              <li>Potential energy --&gt; heat energy. [Using the breaks
                on a bike to maintain the same speed as you go
                downhill.]  </li>
              <li>Electrical energy --&gt; heat energy. [The propeller
                motor; any electrical motor.]  </li>
              <li>Light --&gt; heat energy. [Light shining on the heat
                cell; almost all cases where light is absorbed.]  </li>
              <li>Chemical energy --&gt; electrical energy. [Turning the
                generator by hand, using energy made chemically in your muscle.]</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students might be unsure about what energy turned the
              hand generator. It is simplest to think of the generator
              and crank as a mechanism for converting the chemical
              energy the powers your muscles into electricity. The
              chemicals are sugar and oxygen that you muscles use to
              generate a force while producing carbon dioxide and water.  </p>
            <p>We didn&apos;t emphasize the following, but students did
              experience these in the investigations:  </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Chemical energy --&gt; electrical energy. [The battery
                that ran the propeller&apos;s motor.]</li>
              <li>Heat energy --&gt; light. [The filament of the lamp.]  </li>
              <li>Electrical energy --&gt; electrical energy. [The
                capacitor. Here electrical energy of one kind, current
                and voltage, was transformed into another kind, charge
                in a capacitor.]  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here are some other transformations that students might
              come up with, but were not included in these
              investigations:  </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Heat energy --&gt; kinetic energy. [Steam engine or
                turbine. This is the essential step in any power plant,
                whether the heat energy is supplied by coal, oil, or
                nuclear fission.]  </li>
              <li>Electrical energy --&gt; chemical energy. [Charging a
                battery.]  </li>
              <li>Chemical energy --&gt; kinetic energy. [Rocket engine.
                You could argue that the rocket fuel is converted to
                heat energy in the form of hot gasses and this is
                converted into kinetic energy.]</li>
              <li>Nuclear energy --&gt; heat energy. [Nuclear power
                plant.]  </li>
              <li>Light --&gt; chemical energy. [Photosynthesis, the
                production of sugar in leaves.]  </li>
              <li>Light --&gt; electrical energy. [Solar cell.]  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following are very unusual transformations that are
              included here just in case they come up.  </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Chemical energy --&gt; Light. [Light sticks,
                fireflies, glow worms.]  </li>
              <li>Chemical energy --&gt; Electrical energy. [Fuel cells.
                Electric eel.]  </li>

            </ul>
            <p>Gravity is not a form of energy. A capacitor is not a
              form of energy, although it can store electrical energy.
              Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic waves, as are
              light and radio waves. All forms of electromagnetic waves
              carry energy at the speed of light. A klystron converts
              electrical energy into microwaves to cook your food.  </p>
          </teacher-wrap>
        </teacher-discuss>
        <teacher-background>A generator works on the principle that when
          a wire is moved through a magnetic field, as a result current
          is produced in the wire. In the Genecon, a coil of wire is
          whirled around between two magnets, and current is produced in
          the coil. The faster you turn the coil, the more current is
          produced. For the current to flow, the two clips must be
          attached to something that completes the circuit, forming a
          loop for the current to flow through. This could be a light
          bulb, a heater, a motor, or a capacitor.   <shared-image
            name="28_th_generator" screenshot="true"/>
          <p>A motor is a generator working in reverse. When a current
            is run through the coils of the Genecon, a force is exerted
            on each wire. This makes the handle spin. In a generator,
            spinning creates a current. In a motor, current creates
            spinning. Motors and generators of varying sizes work on
            this same principle.   </p>
          <p>A capacitor is a device that stores electrical charges. In
            the simplest capacitor, two metal plates facing each other
            collect opposite charges, which are pushed there by a
            generator or a battery. This takes work to do, because the
            positive charges repel each other, and the negative charges
            do the same. This work is the same as the energy added to
            the capacitor. As the capacitor becomes charged, adding more
            charge gets harder and harder. The energy graph of the input
            should be steep at first and then level off, indicating that
            no more energy can be added.   </p>
          <shared-image name="30_th_capacitor" screenshot="true"/>
          <p>When the leads of the charged capacitor are connected
            across something, such as a motor, the charges flow until
            the capacitor is neutral again, and the energy is given back
            to the motor.   </p>
          <p>The energy in a charged capacitor is electrical potential
            energy. This is analogous to the gravitational potential
            energy in the Potential and Kinetic Energy investigation.
            One could think of a capacitor as being like a water tower,
            where water can be pumped up high into the water tower and
            then flows downward and can be converted to some other form
            of energy. In the case of the water tower, the energy
            depends on the force of gravity. In the case of the
            capacitor, it depends on electrical forces between the
            charges.   </p>
          <p>In reality there are no moving &quot;positive&quot;
            charges. Negatively charged electrons travel in a wire. A
            surplus of electrons creates a net negative charge, and a
            shortage of electrons creates a net positive charge. The
            diagram above is a common way to represent this situation. </p>
          <p>Capacitors, with their ability to store electrical energy
            and release it very fast, have many uses. A familiar one is
            the flash on a camera. A very small amount of energy is
            released so fast that it makes a bright, but brief, light.
            When one tries to run a motor with a capacitor, however, it
            won&apos;t work well. The energy will all come out quickly,
            and in this case the total amount of energy is small. So the
            air cart motor won&apos;t run very long. A battery, which
            stores electrical potential energy in chemical form, has a
            slower, steadier output. </p>
          <p>Stored electrical energy can also be used to heat things.
            The heat cell is a resistor inside a block of aluminum. As
            the capacitor discharges, the electrons flow through the
            resistor and hit molecules along the way. This makes them
            move around with more energy, and the temperature rises.
            This change will be small but detectable using the heat cell
            and the Temperature probe.   </p>
          <p>The heat cell can also be warmed with sunlight. Light
            photons striking the aluminum are absorbed and give their
            energy to the aluminum atoms. A black surface will absorb
            more photons than a light or shiny surface, so it will heat
            up faster.   </p>
          <p>By focusing the sunlight, dramatic heating can be observed.
            The Fresnel lens is a special way of making a lens with a
            minimal amount of thickness. It was originally devised for
            the enormous glass lenses in lighthouses, which were both
            beautiful and extremely useful, because a small light source
            could be focused and seen from far away. (See, for example,
            http://acept.la.asu.edu/PiN/rdg/fresnel/fresnel.shtml and
            http://lighthousegetaway.com/lights/fresnel.html.) </p>
          <p>The little plastic lens in the kit does the same thing, for
            less than $0.50! It consists of a series of concentric
            rings. One side is smooth and the other side is steeper as
            the distance from the center increases. Light bends
            (refracts) as it enters and leaves the plastic, because the
            speed of light is less in plastic than in air. The steeper
            the face of the ring, the more the light bends. So the light
            farthest from the center bends the most, and all the light
            rays come to the same focus.</p>
          <shared-image name="01_fresnel" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>Sunlight has a lot of energy, but it is spread out thinly.
            A lens concentrates it from a larger to a smaller area,
            magnifying its heating effect. Students could explore the
            ratios involved, such as the area of the Fresnel lens
            compared to the area of the focused light on the heat cell.
            Strong sunlight has about 0.1 watts per square centimeter,
            so one side of the heat cell facing the sun receives less
            than 0.3 watts. The Fresnel lens, however, collects about 3
            watts of power or 3 joules/second, ten times as much because
            it has ten times the area. This should cause a temperature
            rise in the heat cell of 0.3 degree C/second, because it
            takes 10 joules to raise the heat cell one degree. Students
            can look at the slope of their temperature graph and compare
            it to this &quot;ideal&quot; energy rate. </p>
          <p>The Fast Response Temperature Probe uses a thermocouple to
            measure temperature. A thermocouple a made from two special
            wires, each of a different metal, with their ends twisted
            together or welded. When the temperature of that joint is
            different from the temperature of the other ends of the
            wires, a slight but highly predictable voltage is created.
            It comes from the way the two metals interact. Thermocouples
            are useful because they can work at very high temperatures.
            The CC Temperature probe can be put in a candle flame
            without damage.   </p>
          <shared-image name="05_tempProbe" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>The only sensitive part is the tip where two special bare
            wires are twisted together. The wires produce a voltage
            depending on the temperature, and the CCProbe software
            converts this to degrees (C or F). The response is very
            fast, because the two wires are small and easily heated or
            cooled by whatever they touch.   </p>
          <shared-image name="07_VIProbe" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>The Voltage/Current Probe measures either voltage or
            current. It can also measure both at the same time. The
            CCProbe software can use these readings to calculate and
            display power (watts) and energy (joules).   </p>
          <p>Voltage is like potential energy, The voltage between
            points A and B is a measure of the energy each electron
            could release as it moves from point A to point B in a wire.
            Voltage at one place is always measured relative to some
            other place. Therefore the probe requires two leads, and the
            voltage can be measured just by touching the two leads to
            two places. Voltage difference is measured in volts (V). The
            red clip lead goes to the greater, or positive (+) location,
            and the black clip lead goes to the smaller, or negative (-)
            location. To measure voltage across a heat cell , the clips
            are placed on the two ends of the heat cell as shown.  </p>
          <shared-image name="01_vi" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>Current is the amount of electricity flowing, a bit like
            the current in a stream. Current can be pictured as the
            total number of electrons flowing per second through a wire
            or other substance. You can imagine measuring current by
            setting up a tollbooth in a wire and simply counting how
            many electrons went by each second. Current is measured in
            amperes (A). </p>
          <p>To measure the current in a wire, you have to set up a
            tollbooth by breaking the wire and forcing the current to go
            through your current probe. The convention is that current
            is positive when it flows from a positive to a negative
            voltage, that is, from red to black. For the current through
            the probe to be positive, it should flow into the yellow
            clip lead and out of the green clip lead. Here is how to
            measure current going through a heat cell attached to a
            battery. Note: positioning of the probe is different while
            measuring current then it when measuring voltage.   </p>
          <shared-image name="02_vi" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>Electrical power, the rate of using energy, is the voltage
            difference times current. It can be pictured as the number
            of electrons flowing per second, multiplied by the energy
            each one loses (P=IV). Power is measured in watts (W).   </p>
          <p>To measure the power going into a heat cell from a battery,
            you must measure both voltage and current. The CCProbeware
            will calculate and display the power from these
            measurements. </p>
          <shared-image name="03_vi" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>Electrical energy is the power accumulated over time. It
            can be pictured as the total number of electrons that flow,
            multiplied by the energy that each one gains (or loses).
            Energy is measured in joules (J). To measure the energy
            transferred into a heat cell from a battery, you must
            measure both voltage and current (see diagram above). The
            CCProbeware will calculate and display the energy from these
            measurements.   </p>
          <p>Depending on your needs, the Voltage/Current probe can be a
            volt meter, an ammeter, a power meter, or a joule meter!   </p>

          <step>You already know that electrical energy can be stored in
            a battery. There is an even more direct way with a

          <teacher-overview>The diagrams students made in the previous
            investigation suggest that there could be chains of energy
            transformations, where energy goes from form A to B to C and
            so on. Students will investigate such multiple
            transformations in this investigation.  <p>Most energy we
              encounter has gone through multiple transformations. Here
              are some examples.   </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The light from a flashlight comes from thermal energy
                of a filament, which can be traced back through
                electrical energy to the chemical energy of the battery.
                The battery required energy inputs to purify the zinc or
                other metal it uses.   </li>
              <li>The energy to get a bike moving comes from muscles
                that burn sugars made from food. The energy in food can
                be traced back to sunlight that green plants converted
                to sugars. </li>
              <li>In the sun, the fusion of hydrogen releases thermal
                energy that causes the gasses to glow, releasing
                electromagnetic energy in the form of light. This light
                travels across space and a tiny amount makes sugar in
                green plants. This provides all the energy in our food
                and long ago initiated a chain of reactions that
                resulted in coal, gas fuel, and oil.   </li>
            </ul>
          </teacher-overview>
          <teacher-stage>Have students look at their circle-arrow
            diagrams of energy transformations. Up to now, they have
            focussed on only one transformation. It should be clear from
            these diagrams that energy could be transformed many times.
              <p>Ask students:</p>
            <p>Suggest common situations that involve two energy
              transformations. Suggest situations that involve three or
              more energy transformations. &quot;Why does it make sense
              to heat your house (increase its heat energy) using
              electricity (electrical energy) that was derived from coal
              (chemical energy)? Why not heat with coal?&quot;
              [Electricity is more convenient. The power plant can be
              far away.]  </p>
            <p>Have students pretend to be the patent office. What would
              they think of an inventor who claims that he can transform
              one form of energy into MORE energy of a different form?
              For instance, For instance, suppose someone had an
              invention for converting a certain amount of heat energy
              into more electrical energy.  </p>
            <p>The answer is that this invention is impossible. If it
              were possible, you could use it to make unlimited amounts
              of electrical energy. Here is how you could do this. Start
              with some electrical energy and use a resistor to the same
              amount of heat energy. This invention could then produce
              more electricity, and so on. Cycling the energy back and
              forth between heat and electricity would result in
              unlimited amounts of energy. This is impossible.  </p>
          </teacher-stage>
          <teacher-wrap>Have students identify the forms of energy in
            each of the three trials as well as the way energy was
            transformed. Ask:  <teacher-questions>
              <question>What form of energy did the moving cart in Trial

              <question>What supplied the solar cell with energy?</question>
              <answer>Light.</answer>
              <question>What two energy transforms are demonstrated in
                this trial?</question>
              <answer>light --&gt; electrical energy --&gt; kinetic energy.</answer>
            </teacher-questions>
            <p>Repeat this kind of detailed review of the other two
              trials. The second trail is interesting because it is
              almost the opposite of the first trail. The third trail is
              interesting because the hand crank is used to transform
              the energy two different ways, to and from electrical energy.</p>
            <p>These multiple transformations can stimulate a discussion
              of efficiency. Can you get energy out of heat? Yes, but
              not with 100% efficiency. Think of a steam engine. The
              modern equivalent is a turbine. High-pressure steam
              expands against a cylinder or fan-like blades. The steam
              expands, cools, and looses its energy. This is how energy
              is extracted from a nuclear energy.  </p>
            <p>The final discussion should refer back to the discussion
              about global energy consumption that preceded the first
              investigation in Energy Conversions. Now, that students
              understand how energy is transformed, they should be able
              to think more deeply about global energy issues. The major
              uses of energy are for transportation, heading, and
              industry. Most of that energy comes from the fossil fuels:
              oil, coal, and natural gas. Some comes from nuclear energy
              and a tiny fraction from water dams.  </p>
            <p>Each one of these forms of energy can be transformed into
              electricity and electricity can be converted to almost any
              form of energy we need. This is why different kinds of
              energy conversions are so important. Electricity is not
              efficient because some energy is lost when it is made and
              lots of its energy is lost in transmission. This is why it
              costs less to heat a house with fossil fuels than with
              electricity that was generated from fossil fuels.  </p>
          </teacher-wrap>
        </teacher-discuss>
        <teacher-background>This investigation explores how many common
          devices involve a whole chain of energy transformations that
          we hardly notice because we take them for granted. It includes
          the use of solar cells, generators, lights, motors, and
          falling weights. The amount of energy doesn&apos;t change
          through all of these transformations, although it may be lost
          to the environment, usually as heat. The efficiency of the
          transformation is extremely important in everyday life. For
          instance, only about 30% of the electrical energy generated at
          a power plant arrives at our houses. A gasoline-driven car is
          even less efficient. The wasted energy means more pollution
          and consumption of natural resources.<p>Solar cells use thin
            silicone wafers to convert sunlight directly into electrical
            current. Students will discover that it takes a lot of area
            to obtain very much power. To run an air cart, the sunlight
            is changed into electric current, then into mechanical
            energy with a motor. In a real solar car, there would be the
            additional step of storing the energy chemically in a
            battery. Energy is lost in each step. At best, solar cells
            are about 15% efficient in changing light energy to
            electrical energy. If they were 90% efficient, we could
            probably all live in solar-powered houses and drive
            solar-powered cars. </p>
          <p>Using a generator to light a bulb is the reverse process of
            the solar cell in that mechanical power produces light. But
            the process is an indirect one. The mini light filament
            radiates light by being heated &quot;white-hot&quot; by the
            electrical current that passes through it. It gives off
            non-visible radiation as well, which heats up the
            surroundings. Quite a bit of the energy is lost as heat. It
            is monitored with the Light probe, which uses a photodiode
            to measure light intensity. </p>
          <p>Note that fluorescent light is not effective in powering
            the solar cell. The light emitted from the fluorescent light
            has the wrong wavelengths. Incandescent light has similar
            wavelengths to the Sun. Fluorescent lights are much more
            efficient, however, in converting electrical current into
            visible light. Incandescent lights get very hot, and all of
            that energy is wasted.   </p>
          <p>Hooking two Genecon generators together is an illustration
            of a great use for electricity. Suppose there was a source
            of mechanical power in one place (e.g. a water wheel) and a
            need for power in another (e.g. a flour grinding mill).
            Before electricity, the source of power needed to be
            mechanically connected to the power, with shafts and gears.
            Indeed, early industrial processes were often located near
            the source of power.   </p>
          <p>However, by using an electric generator in one place and an
            electric motor in the other, the two can be connected by
            wires. Electric current flowing in the wires transmits the
            power. This provides enormous flexibility. A large
            hydroelectric dam can supply electricity to small motors
            doing many different things in many places, far from the
            power plant.   </p>
          <p>This investigation also illustrates the idea that a
            generator is a motor in reverse. When a current is run
            through the coils of the Genecon, a force is exerted on each
            wire. This makes the handle spin. In a generator, spinning
            creates a current. In a motor, current creates spinning.
            Motors and generators of varying sizes work on this same
            principle.   </p>
          <p>A pulley wheel attached to a Genecon offers a way to
            quantify the amount of energy put into a motor. The change
            in gravitational potential energy of an object is its weight
            times its change in height. For instance, a 1kg mass has a
            weight of 9.8N. If it falls 2m, it gives up energy in the
            amount of 9.8 newtons * 2 meters = 19.6 joules.   </p>
          <p>The &quot;Rube Goldberg&quot; chain of energy-transforming
            devices is more common in everyday life than we may realize.
            Here are two examples:   </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Refrigerator run by a hydroelectric dam: gravitational
              PE (water behind dam) -&gt; KE (falling water) -&gt;
              whirling turbine blades -&gt; electric power (in wires)
              -&gt; mechanical power (compressor) -&gt; thermodynamic
              energy (compressed refrigerant) -&gt; coldness (heat
              energy)   </li>
            <li>Internal combustion engine: gasoline (energy in chemical
              bonds) -&gt; thermodynamic energy (heat and pressure of
              burning fuel) -&gt; mechanical (pistons moving) -&gt;
              motion of gears and wheels -&gt; moving car  </li>
          </ul>
          <p>But Rube Goldberg didn&apos;t worry about efficiency, and
            we need to keep it constantly in mind in order to make the
            best possible use of our limited natural resources.   </p>
          <shared-image name="02_lightProbeDet" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>The Light Probe has a photodiode that responds mainly to
            visible light, which is also the light needed for
            photosynthesis by plants. It produces a voltage depending on
            the light level. There are two ranges, one that can measure
            bright sunlight, and the other for indoor light.   </p>
          <shared-image name="07_VIProbe" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>The Voltage/Current Probe measures either voltage or
            current. It can also measure both at the same time. The
            CCProbe software can use these readings to calculate and
            display power (watts) and energy (joules).   </p>
          <p>Voltage is like potential energy, The voltage between
            points A and B is a measure of the energy each electron
            could release as it moves from point A to point B in a wire.
            Voltage at one place is always measured relative to some
            other place. Therefore the probe requires two leads, and the
            voltage can be measured just by touching the two leads to
            two places. Voltage difference is measured in volts (V). The
            red clip lead goes to the greater, or positive (+) location,
            and the black clip lead goes to the smaller, or negative (-)
            location. To measure voltage across a heat cell , the clips
            are placed on the two ends of the heat cell as shown.  </p>
          <shared-image name="01_vi" screenshot="false"/>
          <p>Current is the amount of electricity flowing, a bit like
            the current in a stream. Current can be pictured as the
            total number of electrons flowing per second through a wire
            or other substance. You can imagine measuring current by
            setting up a tollbooth in a wire and simply counting how
            many electrons went by each second. Current is measured in
            amperes (A).   </p>
          <p>To measure the current in a wire, you have to set up a
            tollbooth by breaking the wire and forcing the current to go
            through your current probe. The convention is that current
            is positive when it flows from a positive to a negative
            voltage, that is, from red to black. For the current through
            the probe to be positive, it should flow into the yellow
            clip lead and out of the green clip lead. Here is how to
            measure current going through a heat cell attached to a
            battery. Note: positioning of the probe is different while
            measuring current then it when measuring voltage.   </p>
          <shared-image name="02_vi"/>
          <p>Electrical power, the rate of using energy, is the voltage
            difference times current. It can be pictured as the number
            of electrons flowing per second, multiplied by the energy
            each one loses (P=IV). Power is measured in watts (W).   </p>
          <p>To measure the power going into a heat cell from a battery,
            you must measure both voltage and current. The CCProbeware
            will calculate and display the power from these
            measurements.   </p>

          <p>Electrical energy is the power accumulated over time. It
            can be pictured as the total number of electrons that flow,
            multiplied by the energy that each one gains (or loses).
            Energy is measured in joules (J). To measure the energy
            transferred into a heat cell from a battery, you must
            measure both voltage and current (see diagram above). The
            CCProbeware will calculate and display the energy from these
            measurements.   </p>
          <p>Depending on your needs, the Voltage/Current probe can be a
            volt meter, an ammeter, a power meter, or a joule meter!   </p>

      <summary>Investigate how energy can be transformed through several

      <question>What energy transformations are used in everyday
        devices? </question>
      <intro>
        <ext-image name="multipleNRG"/>In this activity you investigate
        energy being transformed through several steps to obtain a
        useful form.  </intro>
      <think name="think">We use many devices that transform energy from
        one form to         another. Sometimes a whole chain of
        transformations takes place.         They often do it so
        smoothly that we don&apos;t even realize         what&apos;s
        happening. Each step usually involves some loss of
        useful energy. An automobile engine, for instance, is only 30
        per cent efficient. That is, only 30 percent of the available
        energy in gasoline is available to move the car.
