     * to build this directly into the objects.  If there was 
     * a clean up call when the object was gc'd then this would
     * be cleaner.
     * 
     * How does real Java do this?
     * The other options is to keep all objects in the cache while
     * a transaction is open.  And remove them all when the transaction
     * is closed.  This would mean that when the objects are loaded at
     * the beginning they'd need a name that could be used to identify
     * them when they are saved at the end.

     * The odmg doesn't apear to handle this at all.  When an object
     * is loaded or lookedup it doesn't necessarly handle
